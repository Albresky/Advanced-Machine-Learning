[2024-12-31 13:38:46,023][INFO] [Judge] [Truth]: Janet sells 16 - 3 - 4 = <<16-3-4=9>>9 duck eggs a day.
She makes 9 * 2 = $<<9*2=18>>18 every day at the farmer’s market.
#### 18
[2024-12-31 13:38:46,023][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: First find the number of eggs Janet eats: 3 eggs / day * 7 days / week * 4 weeks / month = 84 eggs / week. Then subtract the number of eggs she eats from the number of eggs she lays to find the number of eggs she sells: 16 eggs / day - 3 eggs / day = 13 eggs / day. Then multiply the number of eggs she sells by the number of days per week to find the number of eggs she sells per week: 13 eggs / day * 7 days / week = 91 eggs / week. Then multiply the number of eggs she sells by the number of weeks per month to find the number of eggs she sells per month: 91 eggs / week * 4 weeks / month = 364 eggs / month. Then multiply the number of eggs she sells by the price she sells them for to find the total amount of money she makes: 364 eggs / month * $2 / egg = $728 / month. Then divide the amount of money she makes by the number of days per month to find the average amount of money she makes per day: $728 / month / 30 days / month = $24 / day.
The answer: 24.

[2024-12-31 13:38:49,215][INFO] [Judge] [Truth]: The cost of the house and repairs came out to 80,000+50,000=$<<80000+50000=130000>>130,000
He increased the value of the house by 80,000*1.5=<<80000*1.5=120000>>120,000
So the new value of the house is 120,000+80,000=$<<120000+80000=200000>>200,000
So he made a profit of 200,000-130,000=$<<200000-130000=70000>>70,000
#### 70000
[2024-12-31 13:38:49,215][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: The house was bought for $80,000 and $50,000 in repairs was added, meaning the house is now worth $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000. The profit Josh made is the difference between the house's new value and its old value, which is $130,000 - $80,000 = $50,000.

[2024-12-31 13:38:52,867][INFO] [Judge] [Truth]: If each chicken eats 3 cups of feed per day, then for 20 chickens they would need 3*20=<<3*20=60>>60 cups of feed per day.
If she feeds the flock 15 cups of feed in the morning, and 25 cups in the afternoon, then the final meal would require 60-15-25=<<60-15-25=20>>20 cups of chicken feed.
#### 20
[2024-12-31 13:38:52,867][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: Wendi gives her chickens 15 cups of feed in the morning and another 25 cups of feed in the afternoon for a total of 15 + 25 = 40 cups of feed. Wendi gives her flock of chickens 3 cups of feed per chicken per day and has 20 chickens so 3 * 20 = 60 cups of feed. 40 cups of feed and 60 cups of feed = 100 cups of feed.
The answer: 100.

[2024-12-31 13:38:54,177][INFO] [Judge] [Truth]: The discount price of one glass is 60/100 * 5 = $<<60/100*5=3>>3.
If every second glass is cheaper, that means Kylar is going to buy 16 / 2 = <<16/2=8>>8 cheaper glasses.
So for the cheaper glasses, Kylar is going to pay 8 * 3 = $<<8*3=24>>24.
And for the regular-priced glasses, Kylar will pay 8 * 5 = $<<8*5=40>>40.
So in total Kylar needs to pay 24 + 40 = $<<24+40=64>>64 for the glasses he wants to buy.
#### 64
[2024-12-31 13:38:54,177][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: The cost of one glass is $5, so the cost of every second glass is $5 * 60 / 100 = $3. Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, so the cost for them is $3 * 16 = $48.
The answer: 48.

[2024-12-31 13:39:01,194][INFO] [Judge] [Truth]: When he turned around he was 3*60=<<3*60=180>>180 miles from home
He was only able to drive 4-2=<<4-2=2>>2 hours in the first four hours
In half an hour he goes 30*.5=<<30*.5=15>>15 miles
He then drives another 2-.5=<<2-.5=1.5>>1.5 hours
In that time he goes 80*1.5=<<80*1.5=120>>120 miles
So he drove 120+15=<<120+15=135>>135 miles
So he is 180-135=<<180-135=45>>45 miles away from home
#### 45
[2024-12-31 13:39:01,194][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: He is driving for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph, so he drives 3 * 60 = 180 miles. He then turns around and drives back home, which takes 2 hours. He spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he is not driving. He then drives for the next half - hour at a speed of 30 mph, so he drives 30 * .5 = 15 miles. He then gets to driving again, and drives for the remaining 2 hours, at a speed of 80 mph. So he drives 80 * 2 = 160 miles. So in total, he drives 180 + 0 + 15 + 160 = 355 miles. Since he is driving home, he is not far from home at the end of those 4 hours.

So, 20 - 4 = <<20-4=16>>16 students are enrolled in either jazz or hip-hop dance.
There are 16 x 25/100 = <<16*25/100=4>>4 students who enrolled in jazz dance.
Hence, 16 - 4 = <<16-4=12>>12 students enrolled in hip-hop dance.
This is 12/20 x 100% = 60% of the entire students.
#### 60
[2024-12-31 13:39:14,579][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: The number of students enrolled in contemporary dance is 20% of the total number of students, meaning 20 / 100 * 20 = 4 students. The number of students enrolled in jazz dance is 25% of the total number of students, meaning 25 / 100 * 20 = 5 students. The number of students enrolled in hip - hop dance is the remaining number of students, which is 20 - 4 - 5 = 11 students. The percentage of the entire class enrolled in hip - hop dance is 11 / 20 * 100 = 55%.
[2024-12-31 13:39:19,690][INFO] [Judge] [Truth]: If he purchases jewelry, he will make a profit of 2.5% which is $5000*(2.5/100) = $<<5000*(2.5/100)=125>>125
If he purchases electronic gadgets, he will make a profit of 1.2% which is $8000*(1.2/100) = $<<8000*(1.2/100)=96>>96
If he wants to maximize profit, since $125 > $96, he will choose to purchase jewelry, thereby making a profit of $<<125=125>>125
#### 125
[2024-12-31 13:39:19,690][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: First, we need to determine the total increase in value of the jewelry and electronic gadgets. The increase in value for the jewelry is 2.5% * $5,000 = $1,250. The increase in value for the electronic gadgets is 1.2% * $8,000 = $960.

Next, we need to determine the total cost of the jewelry and electronic gadgets. The total cost of the jewelry is $5,000 + $1,250 = $6,250. The total cost of the electronic gadgets is $8,000 + $960 = $9,960.

Now, we can calculate the merchant's profit if he chooses the jewelry plan. The merchant's profit would be $6,250 - $5,000 = $1,250.

If the merchant chooses the electronic gadgets plan, his profit would be $9,960 - $8,000 = $1,960.

Therefore, the merchant would make $1,250 profit if he chooses the jewelry plan and $1,960 profit if he chooses the electronic gadgets plan.

Next subtract the time Marissa already spent walking to find out how much time she has left: 3 hours - 1 hour - 1 hour = <<3-1-1=1>>1 hour
Now figure out how much distance she has left by subtracting the distance she already traveled from the total distance: 12 miles - 4 miles - 2 miles = <<12-4-2=6>>6 miles
Now divide the remaining distance by the remaining time to find out how fast in miles per hour Marissa has to travel: 6 miles / 1 hour = <<6/1=6>>6 mph
#### 6
[2024-12-31 13:39:29,435][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: First find the total time it took to walk the first 4 miles: 4 miles / 4 miles / hour = 1 hour. Then find the total time it took to walk the next two miles: 2 miles / 4 miles / hour = 0.5 hours. Then add the time taken for the first two miles to the time taken for the first four miles to find the total time: 1 hour + 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours. Then divide the distance of the trail by the time taken to find Marissa's average speed: 12 miles / 1.5 hours = 8 miles / hour. Then subtract Marissa's average speed from 4 miles / hour to find the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance: 8 miles / hour - 4 miles / hour = 4 miles / hour.

After 1 liter of orange drink was spilled, there were 10 - 1 = <<10-1=9>>9 liters of orange drink left.
Out of the 9 liters, 9 x 2/3 = <<9*2/3=6>>6 liters are water.
Thus, there are a total of 9 + 6 = <<9+6=15>>15 liters of water out of the 24 liters.
#### 15
[2024-12-31 13:39:37,487][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: Step 1: Find the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink: 10 liters \* (2 / 3) = 6.67 liters
Step 2: Find the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink: 15 liters \* (3 / 5) = 9 liters
Step 3: Find the total amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink and the 15 liters of pineapple drink: 6.67 liters + 9 liters = 15.67 liters
Step 4: Subtract the amount of water that was spilled: 15.67 liters - 1 liter = 14.67 liters
Step 5: Convert the amount of water from Step 4 to a percentage: 14.67 liters / 15.67 liters \* 100% = 92.56%
Step 6: Convert the percentage to a volume: 92.56% \* 100% = 92.56 liters
Step 7: Find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters: 24 liters - 1 liter = 23 liters
Step 8: Convert the amount of water from Step 7 to a percentage: 23 liters / 24 liters \* 100% = 91.67%
Step 9: Convert the percentage to a volume: 91.67% \* 100% = 91.67 liters
Step 10: Subtract the amount of water that was added from the original amount of water: 91.67 liters - 14.67 liters = 77 liters
The answer: 77.

[2024-12-31 13:39:38,189][INFO] [Judge] [Truth]: When Raymond's son was born Samantha was 23 - 6 = <<23-6=17>>17 years old.
Thus it has been 31 - 17 = <<31-17=14>>14 years since Raymond's son was born.
#### 14
[2024-12-31 13:39:38,189][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, so Raymond's son was born 31 - 6 = 25 years ago. The answer: 25.

[2024-12-31 13:39:41,066][INFO] [Judge] [Truth]: The candle burns for 5 - 1 = <<5-1=4>>4 hours.
Thus, the candle will be 2 * 4 = <<2*4=8>>8 centimeters shorter.
#### 8
[2024-12-31 13:39:41,066][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: The number of hours that the candle burns is 5:00 - 1:00 = 4 hours. The number of centimeters the candle burns in 4 hours is 4 * 2 = 8 centimeters.
The final answer: 8.
[2024-12-31 13:39:43,080][INFO] [Judge] [Truth]: Let X be the original price of the book. The discounted price is X - X*25% = $19.50.
Combining like terms, we get .75X = $19.50
Dividing both sides by .75, we get X = $26.
#### 26
[2024-12-31 13:39:43,080][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: The original price of the book can be found by dividing the discount price by the discount percentage. In this case, the discount percentage is 100% - 25% = 75%. The 25% discount means that the book costs only 75% of the original price. Therefore, the original price of the book can be calculated as follows: $19.50 / 0.75 = $26.00. So the answer is 26.
[2024-12-31 13:39:45,784][INFO] [Judge] [Truth]: Five packs of milk cost $3 x 5 = $<<3*5=15>>15.
Four apples cost $1.50 x 4 = $<<1.5*4=6>>6.
The total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples is $12 + $15 + $6 = $<<12+15+6=33>>33.
Thus, the boxes of pizza cost $50 - $33 = $<<50-33=17>>17.
Therefore, Marie ordered $17/$8.50 = <<17/8.5=2>>2 boxes of pizza.
#### 2
[2024-12-31 13:39:45,784][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: Marie spent a total of $50 - $12 = $38 for the chicken meal and 5 packs of milk. The total cost for the 5 packs of milk is $3 x 5 = $15. The total cost for the 4 apples is $1.50 x 4 = $6. The total cost for the 5 items is $15 + $6 = $21. The remaining amount she spent for the boxes of pizza is $50 - $21 = $29. The number of boxes of pizza that Marie ordered is $29 / $8.50 = 3. The answer is 3.

[2024-12-31 13:39:50,441][INFO] [Judge] [Truth]: Each container of ice cream has 15 servings and she eats 1 serving a night so after 60 days she will need 60/15 = 4 containers of ice cream
If each carton costs $4.00 and she needs 4 containers then it will cost her 4*4 = $<<4*4=16.00>>16.00
#### 16
[2024-12-31 13:39:50,441][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: Since she eats one serving of ice cream every night and the cartons have 15 servings per carton, she eats 15 servings of ice cream per night.  Since there are 60 days in 60 days, she will have eaten 60 servings of ice cream.  Since each carton has 15 servings, the cartons will have been consumed in 60 / 15 = 4 cartons.  Since each carton costs $4.00, the 4 cartons will have cost 4 * 4 = $16.00.

Henry traveled 60 miles - 35 miles = <<60-35=25>>25 miles between his first and second stop.
#### 25
[2024-12-31 13:39:52,238][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: His first stop was 20 miles from the start so that means he covered 60 - 20 = 40 miles between the first two stops. The second stop was 15 miles from the end so that means he covered 60 - 15 = 45 miles from the second stop to the end. In total he covered 40 + 45 = 85 miles. The answer: 85.

[2024-12-31 13:39:53,865][INFO] [Judge] [Truth]: The second pair of heels costs 33 * 2 = $<<33*2=66>>66.
The heels together cost 66 + 33 = $<<66+33=99>>99.
The boots cost $5 more than both pairs of heels together, so the boots cost 99 + 5 = $104.
#### 104
[2024-12-31 13:39:53,865][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: If one pair of heels costs $33, then the other pair costs $33 * 2 = $66. The two pairs of heels together cost $66 + $33 = $99. The boots are cheaper by $99 - $5 = $94. Therefore, the boots costs $94 / 2 = $47.

[2024-12-31 13:39:56,303][INFO] [Judge] [Truth]: The total ratio representing their ages is 7+11= <<7+11=18>>18
Since the fraction of the ratio that represents Allen's age is 11/18, Allen's current age is 11/18*162 = <<11/18*162=99>>99
If Allen is currently 99 years old, in 10 years he will be 99+10 = <<99+10=109>>109 years old
#### 109
[2024-12-31 13:39:56,303][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: The total ratio representing the ages of Darrell and Allen is 7 + 11 = 18 / 18 = 1 : 1. Since the sum of their ages now is 162, and the ratio is 1 : 1, then the sum of their ages is equal to 162 * 1 = 162. The age of Darrell is 1 / 2 * 162 = 81.

Allen's age 10 years from now will be 81 + 10 = 91 years.

The second guessed 100 because 80 x 1.25 = <<80*1.25=100>>100
The total amount guessed is 240 because 80 + 60 + 100 = <<80+60+100=240>>240
The average amount guessed is 80 because 240 / 3 = <<240/3=80>>80
#### 80
[2024-12-31 13:39:59,027][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: First find the first person's guess: 80. Then multiply that number by 2 to find the second person's guess: 80 * 2 = 160. Then divide that number by 2 to find the third person's guess: 160 / 2 = 80. Then add the first, second, and third person's guess to find the total: 80 + 160 + 80 = 320. Then divide the total guess by the number of people to find the average guess: 320 / 3 = 106. The answer: 106.

He earned $165 from his sale because 160 + 5 = <<160+5=165>>165
He sold 11 lego sets because 11 x 15 = <<11*15=165>>165
He has 2 sets left because 13 - 11 = <<13-11=2>>2
#### 2
[2024-12-31 13:40:07,607][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: He spent 15 x 13 = $195 on lego sets. He spent 20 x 8 = $160 on video games. He spent a total of $195 + $160 = $355. So he was left with $5 + $355 = $360. This means he had $360 - $13 x $15 = $210 after selling the lego sets. Therefore, he still has 13 lego sets.
[2024-12-31 13:40:08,911][INFO] [Judge] [Truth]: He has 7-1=<<7-1=6>>6 possible running days.
He runs half of those so he runs 6/2=<<6/2=3>>3 days.
So for two days, he runs 3/2=<<3/2=1.5>>1.5 hours.
So in total, he runs 3+1.5+1.5=<<3+1.5+1.5=6>>6 hours.
So he runs 60/6=<<60/6=10>>10 mph.
#### 10
[2024-12-31 13:40:08,911][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: He runs 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours the second and third day. So he runs a total of 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours. So he runs at a pace of 60 / 6 = 10 mph. The answer: 10.

[2024-12-31 13:40:12,489][INFO] [Judge] [Truth]: If Dana can skip at half the speed she can run, then she can run at 3*2=<<3*2=6>>6 miles per hour.
And since she can run at a speed that is 4 times faster than she can walk, this means she can walk at 6/4=1.5 miles per hour.
If two-thirds of the time is spent walking, then she walks for 6*(2/3)=<<6*(2/3)=4>>4 hours.
If one-third of the time is spent running, then she runs for 6-4=<<6-4=2>>2 hours.
Thus, she runs for 2 hours at 6 miles per hour, or 2*6=<<2*6=12>>12 miles.
She walks for 4 hours at 1.5 miles per hour, or 4*1.5=<<4*1.5=6>>6 miles.
Thus, altogether, she travels 12+6=<<12+6=18>>18 miles.
#### 18
[2024-12-31 13:40:12,489][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: If Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour, then she can run at 3 * 4 = 12 miles per hour. Dana can run at a rate of 12 miles per hour, but she can skip at a rate of 3 miles per hour, so she runs at 12 - 3 = 9 miles per hour. Dana can run for 6 * 3 / 12 = 1.5 hours. Dana can run 1.5 * 9 = 13.5 miles. Dana can walk for 6 * 2 / 3 = 4 hours. Dana can walk 4 * 3 = 12 miles. Dana can travel a total of 13.5 + 12 = 25.5 miles in six hours if she spends one - third of the time running and two - thirds of the time walking.

1200 feet is beyond the 1000-foot reach of the dragon's flames by a distance of 1200-1000=<<1200-1000=200>>200 feet.
#### 200
[2024-12-31 13:40:16,022][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: If the dragon's flames are 1000 feet away from the spot where the dragon is, and Polly is holding the sapphire gemstone, then she can throw the javelin 400 + 300 = 700 feet. This means that the dragon's flames are within 700 - 1000 = 300 feet of the spot where the dragon is. Therefore, Polly can stand outside of the reach of the dragon's flames 300 feet away.

[2024-12-31 13:40:17,939][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: Each pie was cut into 8 pieces, so each pie had 8 pieces remaining after the guests had eaten the pieces.  Since there were 5 pies, there were 5 x 8 = 40 pieces of pie eaten.  Since there were 14 pieces of pie remaining, that means the guests took 40 - 14 = <<40-14=26>>26 pieces of pie.

[2024-12-31 13:40:21,194][INFO] [Judge] [Truth]: If the total calorie target is 2000 and I have consumed 1800 calories then I have 2000-1800 = <<2000-1800=200>>200 calories left to eat
If each serving of chips has 250 calories and I only have 200 calories left to eat, then I can only eat 200/250 of a serving = 4/5 of a serving
We also know that a 300g bag of chips has 5 servings, hence each serving has 300g/5 = <<300/5=60>>60 grams
If I can only eat 4/5 of a serving, then I can eat only 60g * 4/5 = 240g/5 = 48 grams
#### 48
[2024-12-31 13:40:21,194][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: You can eat 2000 - 1800 = 200g of chips per day if you want to stay under your daily calorie target. And the bag has 250 calories per serving, so you can eat 200g / 250 calories = 8 servings of chips per day. Therefore, you can eat 8 servings x 300g = 2400g of chips per day. So you can eat 2400g - 5 x 250g = 1900g of chips per day if you want to stay under your daily calorie target. Therefore, you can eat 1900g / 1000g = 19 servings of chips per day.

[2024-12-31 13:40:29,125][INFO] [Judge] [Truth]: He bought 200 / 40 = <<200/40=5>>5 blue ties
So he bought 5 * 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 red ties
Each red tie cost $40 * .5 = $<<40*.5=20>>20 more than blue ties
So they each cost $40 + $20 = $<<40+20=60>>60
So he spent $60 * 10 = $<<60*10=600>>600 on red ties
So he spent $200 + $600 = $<<200+600=800>>800 on ties
#### 800
[2024-12-31 13:40:29,125][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: He spent 2 * 40 = 80 dollars on red ties. The red ties cost 40 * .5 = 20 dollars more than the blue ties. So the blue ties cost 40 - 20 = 20 dollars. So he spent 200 + 80 + 20 = 208 dollars.
The answer: 208.

[2024-12-31 13:40:30,786][INFO] [Judge] [Truth]: If Tracy used a piece of wire 4 feet long, since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the total length of the wire in inches was 12*4=<<12*4=48>>48 inches.
Since the wire was cut into pieces 6 inches long, Tracy obtained 48/6=<<48/6=8>>8 pieces
#### 8
[2024-12-31 13:40:30,786][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 1 foot of wire is equal to 12 inches, so 4 feet of wire is equal to 48 inches. 48 inches of wire can be cut into 60 inches of pieces because 48 / 6 = 60. 60 pieces of wire are equal to 10 pieces because 60 / 6 = 10. The answer is 10.
[2024-12-31 13:40:33,017][INFO] [Judge] [Truth]: The total number of units in the building will be 8 units/floor * 15 floors = <<8*15=120>>120 units.
If 3/4 of the building is occupied, then the total number of occupied units is 3/4 * 120 units = <<3/4*120=90>>90 units.
The total number of unoccupied units is 120 units - 90 units = <<120-90=30>>30 units.
#### 30
[2024-12-31 13:40:33,017][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: If the apartment building has 15 floors and each floor has 8 units, the total number of units in the building is 15 floors \* 8 units / floor = 120 units. Since 3 / 4 of the building is occupied, there are 120 units \* 3 / 4 = 90 units in the building that are occupied. The number of unoccupied units in the building is 120 units - 90 units = 30 units.
The answer: 30.

[2024-12-31 13:40:35,171][INFO] [Judge] [Truth]: In a week, Lloyd's egg farm produces 252 x 7 = <<252*7=1764>>1764 eggs.
There are 1764/12 = <<1764/12=147>>147 dozens of eggs produced in a week.
So, Lloyd makes 147 x $2 = $<<147*2=294>>294 on eggs.
#### 294
[2024-12-31 13:40:35,171][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: Each week, Lloyd sells his eggs for 252 eggs / day * 7 days / week = 1764 eggs / week. If 1 dozen = 12 eggs, then 1764 eggs / week / 12 eggs / dozen = 142 dozen eggs / week. If 1 dozen egg costs $2, then 142 dozen eggs / week * $2 / dozen = $284.40 / week.
The answer: 284.40.

Since Trixie's kittens are 12, both cats have 21 +12 = <<21+12=33>>33 kittens.
Combining the adopted kittens with those from the two cats, the Doubtfire family now has 7 + 33 = <<7+33=40>>40 kittens.
#### 40
[2024-12-31 13:43:27,133][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: The Doubtfire sisters have a total of 7 + 2 = <<7+2=9>>9 kittens. The mother calls to inform them that their two house cats have had kittens. She tells them that Patchy, the first cat, has had thrice the number of adopted kittens, while Trixie, the other cat, has had 12. We know that Patchy has had 3 * 7 = <<3*7=21>>21 adopted kittens. Trixie has had 12 adopted kittens. In total, the Doubtfire family has had 21 + 12 = <<21+12=33>>33 adopted kittens. Therefore, the Doubtfire family now has a total of 9 + 33 = <<9+33=42>>42 kittens.

[2024-12-31 13:43:34,420][INFO] [Judge] [Truth]: The boxes can weigh up to 5000 pounds - 3755 pounds = <<5000-3755=1245>>1245 pounds in total.
There can be 1245 / 15 = <<1245/15=83>>83 boxes loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit.
#### 83
[2024-12-31 13:43:34,421][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: Let's first calculate the total weight of the truck and the bridge. The total weight of the truck is 3755 + 15 = 3770 pounds. The total weight of the bridge is 5000 pounds. We want to find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit, which is 5000 pounds.

We can calculate the total weight of the boxes by multiplying the weight of each box by the number of boxes. Let's say the number of boxes is x. The total weight of the boxes is 15x pounds.

We want to find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit, which is the total weight of the boxes plus the weight of the truck. This can be expressed as:

15x + 3770 <= 5000

We will solve for x:

15x <= 1220

x <= 83.33

Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck is 83.
[2024-12-31 13:43:36,076][INFO] [Judge] [Truth]: He spent $40.00 on groceries but they charged him a 25% fee so that's 40*.25 = $10.00

The insurance was 1300*.1=$<<1300*.1=130>>130
So she pays 1300+130=$<<1300+130=1430>>1430
#### 1430
[2024-12-31 13:43:40,934][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: The total cost of the brooch was $500 + $800 = $1300. She paid $1300 * 10% = $130 for the insurance. So the total cost of the brooch was $1300 + $130 = $<<1300+130=1430>>1430.
[2024-12-31 13:43:44,478][INFO] [Judge] [Truth]: First find how many years Marcy works after 20 years: 30 years - 20 years = <<30-20=10>>10 years
Then multiply that number by the amount of her pension she gets per year: 10 years * 5% = 50%
Then multiply that percentage by the total amount of the full pension to find how much she gets: $50,000 * 50% = $<<50000*50*.01=25000>>25,000
#### 25000
[2024-12-31 13:43:44,478][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: First calculate the value of the pension before the 20th year: $50,000 / year * 20 years = $1,000,000. Then calculate the percentage of the value of the pension that Marcy is entitled to: 5 / 100 = 0.05. Multiply the value of the pension by the percentage to find out how much Marcy is entitled to: $1,000,000 * 0.05 = $50,000. Then subtract the amount of the pension from the amount Marcy gets each year to find out how much she will get each year: $50,000 - $50,000 = $0. Therefore, if Marcy quits after 30 years, her annual pension will be $0.
[2024-12-31 13:43:47,720][INFO] [Judge] [Truth]: A year has twelve months, so a half of the year is 12/2 = <<12/2=6>>6 months,
For the first six months, the streaming service charged her a total of 6*140 = $<<6*140=840>>840
For the next half of the year, the streaming service company charged her 10/100*140 = $<<10/100*140=14>>14 less
She paid $140-$14 = $<<140-14=126>>126 each month for the remaining half of the year,
In total, she paid 126*6 = $<<126*6=756>>756 for the other half of the year for the streaming service.
The total amount of money she paid at the end of the year is $840+$756 = $<<840+756=1596>>1596
#### 1596
[2024-12-31 13:43:47,720][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: The first half of the year consists of 6 months, so if the streaming company charged Aleena $140 for the first 6 months, then she paid $140 * 6 = $840 for the first 6 months.

For the second half of the year, the streaming company charged Aleena 10% less money, which is $140 - ($140 * (10 / 100)) = $136 less. In total, Aleena paid $840 + $136 = $976 for the second half of the year.

Thus, the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is $840 + $976 = $1816.

#### 300
[2024-12-31 13:43:49,948][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: Sophia's car uses 12 gallons of gas to travel 100 miles, so each gallon of gas will allow her to drive 100 / 12 = 8.33 miles. Sophia will have 12 gallons of gas remaining, so she can drive 12 * 8.33 = 99.96 miles before running out of gas. Therefore, Sophia can drive 100 - 100 / 12 = 99 miles on a single tank of gas.

[2024-12-31 13:44:02,829][INFO] [Judge] [Truth]: A $150 x 2/100 = $<<150*2/100=3>>3 interest will be charged for each unit.
So, each cell phone costs $150 + $3 = $<<150+3=153>>153.
The total amount to be paid for 5 cell phones is $153 x 5 = $<<153*5=765>>765.
Thus, Shiela will pay $765/3 = $<<765/3=255>>255 each month.
#### 255
[2024-12-31 13:44:02,829][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: Five cell phones for $150 each is a total of $150 x 5 = $750. The total amount for the 3 - month installment is $750 x 3 = $2250. The interest fee is $2250 x 2 / 100 = $45. So, the total amount of the loan is $2250 + $45 = $2295. Therefore, Shiela will pay $2295 / 3 = $732.50 each month for 3 months.

Artie will round his begonias down from $2.12 to $2, since the number following the 2 is less than 5.
Artie sells 12 marigolds x $3 = $<<12*3=36>>36
Artie sells 9 petunias x $2 = $<<9*2=18>>18
Artie sells 17 begonias x $2 = $<<17*2=34>>34
Altogether, Artie will make $36 + $18 + $34 = $<<36+18+34=88>>88
#### 88
[2024-12-31 13:44:05,303][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: Artie will make 12 * $2.74 = $32.88 from selling his marigolds. He will make 9 * $1.87 = $16.83 from selling his petunias. He will make 17 * $2.12 = $35.64 from selling his begonias. Overall he will make $32.88 + $16.83 + $35.64 = $84.35. He will round his total to the nearest dollar and his final answer will be $84.

He goes on 4 vacations a year, so he has been on 4 * 11 = <<4*11=44>>44 vacations.
Gene has 1 shirt from each vacation, so he has 44 * 1 = <<44*1=44>>44 quilt blocks in all.
#### 44
[2024-12-31 13:44:25,912][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: Gene has been on 4 vacations and has been vacationing since he was 23 so he has been going on vacations for 23 + 4 = <<23+4=27>>27 years.
He has 1 shirt from each of those 27 vacations and has been sewing a quilt out of those shirts. Each shirt is a separate quilt block.
So in total, he has 27 separate quilt blocks. Since each row is made up of blocks from a different year of vacations, each row has 27 unique blocks.

[2024-12-31 13:44:46,436][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: If Freda’s last batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces of sauce, and each 16 ounce can of tomatoes contains three tomatoes, then Freda used 32 / 16 = 2 cups of tomatoes. Since Freda uses 2 cups of tomatoes per batch, and each cup contains 3 tomatoes, then Freda used 2 * 3 = 6 tomatoes.
The answer: 6.

[2024-12-31 13:44:47,956][INFO] [Judge] [Truth]: The cars that exited do not need to be included so there were 30 original cars – 5 cars that exited = <<30-5=25>>25 cars that drove through the traffic jam.
Most of the cars exited in the final 15 minutes so in the first 15 minutes, there must have been 25 total cars – 20 cars that drove through in the final 15 minutes = 5 cars that drove through the traffic jam.

[2024-12-31 13:44:47,956][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: There are 30 cars on the motorway - 5 cars took an exit so they don't have to drive through the traffic jam. This means there are 30 cars - 5 cars = 25 cars left on the motorway. In the first 15 minutes, 25 cars drive through the traffic jam.
The answer: 25.
