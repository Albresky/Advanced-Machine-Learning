[2024-12-31 14:21:54,748][INFO] [Judge] [Truth]: Janet sells 16 - 3 - 4 = <<16-3-4=9>>9 duck eggs a day.
She makes 9 * 2 = $<<9*2=18>>18 every day at the farmerâ€™s market.
#### 18
[2024-12-31 14:21:54,748][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: First, we calculate how many eggs she has after subtracting the eggs she consumes for breakfast and baking muffins. 
16 eggs - 3 breakfast - 4 muffins = 9 eggs to sell. 

She makes $2 per fresh duck egg, so the total amount she makes each day at the farmers' market is:
9 eggs * $2/egg = $18.

Therefore, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market.
The answer: 18.

[2024-12-31 14:21:58,944][INFO] [Judge] [Truth]: It takes 2/2=<<2/2=1>>1 bolt of white fiber
So the total amount of fabric is 2+1=<<2+1=3>>3 bolts of fabric
#### 3
[2024-12-31 14:21:58,944][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: To find out how many bolts in total it takes, we need to add the bolts of blue fiber to half the bolts of white fiber. 

Bolts of blue fiber = 2
Bolts of white fiber = 2 / 2 = 1

Total bolts = 2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3 bolts in total.

The answer: 3.

[2024-12-31 14:22:00,485][INFO] [Judge] [Truth]: The cost of the house and repairs came out to 80,000+50,000=$<<80000+50000=130000>>130,000
He increased the value of the house by 80,000*1.5=<<80000*1.5=120000>>120,000
So the new value of the house is 120,000+80,000=$<<120000+80000=200000>>200,000
So he made a profit of 200,000-130,000=$<<200000-130000=70000>>70,000
#### 70000
[2024-12-31 14:22:00,485][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: First, we need to calculate the increase in value after the repairs. The increase is 150% of $80,000, which is $120,000.

Next, we need to calculate the total cost for Josh. Josh spent $80,000 to buy the house and $50,000 on repairs, totaling $130,000.

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the increased value. So, $120,000 - $130,000 = $10,000.

Therefore, Josh made a profit of $10,000.

The answer: 10000.

If she feeds the flock 15 cups of feed in the morning, and 25 cups in the afternoon, then the final meal would require 60-15-25=<<60-15-25=20>>20 cups of chicken feed.
#### 20
[2024-12-31 14:22:02,936][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: Wendi feeds her chickens a total of 15 + 25 = 40 cups of feed in the morning and afternoon.
If she has fed each chicken 40 cups of feed and has 20 chickens, Wendi has given her chickens a total of 40 * 20 = 800 cups of feed in the morning and afternoon.
Since she gives her chickens three meals, she has already given them 15 + 25 = 40 cups of feed.
The number of cups she still needs to give her chickens in the final meal is 800 - 40 = 760 cups.
The answer: 760.

[2024-12-31 14:22:04,767][INFO] [Judge] [Truth]: The discount price of one glass is 60/100 * 5 = $<<60/100*5=3>>3.
If every second glass is cheaper, that means Kylar is going to buy 16 / 2 = <<16/2=8>>8 cheaper glasses.
So for the cheaper glasses, Kylar is going to pay 8 * 3 = $<<8*3=24>>24.
And for the regular-priced glasses, Kylar will pay 8 * 5 = $<<8*5=40>>40.
So in total Kylar needs to pay 24 + 40 = $<<24+40=64>>64 for the glasses he wants to buy.
#### 64
[2024-12-31 14:22:04,768][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: First, we calculate the cost of every second glass, which is 60% of $5, making it $3.

Now, Kylar is buying 16 glasses, so we can split them into two parts: 8 glasses at $5 each and 8 glasses at $3 each.

For the first 8 glasses at $5 each, the total cost is 8 * $5 = $40.

For the remaining 8 glasses at $3 each, the total cost is 8 * $3 = $24.

Adding these two totals gives us the final amount Kylar needs to pay:

$40 (first 8 glasses) + $24 (remaining 8 glasses) = $64.

The answer: 64.

Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, which is 2 * 80 sheep = <<2*80=160>>160 sheep
Together, the three has 20 sheep + 160 sheep + 80 sheep = <<20+160+80=260>>260 sheep
#### 260
[2024-12-31 14:22:06,322][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: First, we know that Seattle has 20 sheep. 
Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep. 
Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep. 

Therefore, Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have a total of 20 (Seattle) + 80 (Charleston) + 160 (Toulouse) = 260 sheep together.

Then divide that number by the download rate to find the time until Windows restarts: 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = <<80/2=40>>40 minutes
Then find the time to download the whole file after the restart: 200 GB / 2 GB/minute = <<200/2=100>>100 minutes
Then add the time to download 40% of the file, to download the whole file, and to wait for Windows to update: 40 minutes + 100 minutes + 20 minutes = <<40+100+20=160>>160 minutes
#### 160
[2024-12-31 14:22:08,494][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: To find out how long it takes Carla to download the file, we need to calculate the time she spent before the restart and the time she spent after the restart.

1. Time taken before the restart:
Total time without restart = Total file size / Download speed
Total time without restart = 200 GB / 2 GB/minute = 100 minutes

2. Time taken after the 20-minute restart:
After the restart, Carla has to start over, so she will have to download the entire file again.
Total time after restart = Total file size / Download speed
Total time after restart = 200 GB / 2 GB/minute = 100 minutes

Adding the time before the restart and the time after the restart:
Total time = Time before restart + Time after restart
Total time = 100 minutes + 100 minutes = 200 minutes

Therefore, it takes Carla 200 minutes to download the file.
The answer: 200.

He was only able to drive 4-2=<<4-2=2>>2 hours in the first four hours
In half an hour he goes 30*.5=<<30*.5=15>>15 miles
He then drives another 2-.5=<<2-.5=1.5>>1.5 hours
In that time he goes 80*1.5=<<80*1.5=120>>120 miles
So he drove 120+15=<<120+15=135>>135 miles
So he is 180-135=<<180-135=45>>45 miles away from home
#### 45
[2024-12-31 14:22:10,877][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: First, let's calculate how far John traveled in the first 3 hours: distance = speed * time = 60 mph * 3 hours = 180 miles.

Then, during the 4 hours of the return trip, he spent 2 hours in traffic and 0.5 hours driving at 30 mph, which is a total of 2.5 hours. This means he has 4 hours - 2.5 hours = 1.5 hours left to drive at 80 mph.

We can now calculate the distance he traveled at 30 mph: distance = speed * time = 30 mph * 0.5 hours = 15 miles.

Next, calculate the distance he traveled at 80 mph: distance = speed * time = 80 mph  * 1.5 hours = 120 miles.

Adding up the distance he traveled at 30 mph, 80 mph, and the initial 180 miles, we get: 180 miles + 15 miles + 120 miles = 315 miles.

Therefore, at the end of those 4 hours, he is 315 miles away from home. 

The answer: 315.

Her hourly rate for the overtime pay is $10 x 1.2 = $<<10*1.2=12>>12.
So, Eliza will receive $12 x 5 =$<<12*5=60>>60 for overtime pay.
Her regular weekly earning is $10 x 40 = $<<10*40=400>>400.
Thus, Eliza will receive a total of $400 + $60 = $<<400+60=460>>460 for this week's work.
#### 460
[2024-12-31 14:22:12,782][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: First, let's calculate Eliza's earnings for the first 40 hours:

Earnings for the first 40 hours = 40 hours * $10/hour = $400

Next, let's calculate her overtime pay rate:

Overtime pay rate = $10/hour * 1.2 = $12/hour

Now, let's calculate her earnings for the additional 5 hours of overtime:

Overtime earnings = 5 hours * $12/hour = $60

Finally, let's calculate Eliza's total earnings for the week:

Total earnings = Earnings for the first 40 hours + Overtime earnings = $400 + $60 = $460

Therefore, Eliza's earnings for this week are $460.

The answer: 460.

The total charge for the mini cheesecakes was 6 x $55 = $<<6*55=330>>330.
Therefore the total amount Toula paid for the pastries was $204 + $160 + $330 = $<<204+160+330=694>>694.
#### 694
[2024-12-31 14:22:15,622][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: First, let's calculate the cost of the donuts: 

3 dozen donuts at $68 per dozen = $204 

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes: 

2 dozen mini cupcakes at $80 per dozen = $160 

Now, let's calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes: 

6 dozen mini cheesecakes at $55 per dozen = $330 

Finally, let's add up the total cost of all the pastries: 

Total cost = $204 (donuts) + $160 (mini cupcakes) + $330 (mini cheesecakes) = $694 

So, the total cost of all the pastries Toula bought was $694.

He earns $7.5 each year from the lemon tree because 10.5 - 3 = <<10.5-3=7.5>>7.5
It will take 12 years to earn enough to pay off the tree because 90 / 7.5 = <<90/7.5=12>>12
He will make money in year 13 because 12 + 1 = <<12+1=13>>13
#### 13
[2024-12-31 14:22:17,532][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: First, we need to calculate the annual profit from selling lemons:

Revenue per year = (Number of lemons harvested per year) x (Price per lemon) = 7 x $1.5 = $10.5
Cost per year = Cost of watering and feeding the tree = $3

Now, we calculate the profit per year:
Profit per year = Revenue per year - Cost per year = $10.5 - $3 = $7.5

To determine how many years it will take before Carlos starts earning money on the lemon tree, we divide the initial cost by the annual profit:
Years to start earning money = Cost of planting the tree / Profit per year = $90 / $7.5 = 12

The answer: 12.

Then add two to figure out how many vacuum cleaners she had before visiting the red house: 10 + 2 = <<10+2=12>>12
Now we know that 2/3 * x = 12, where x is the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with. We can find x by dividing each side of the equation by 2/3, which produces x = 18
#### 18
[2024-12-31 14:22:19,679][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: First, let's represent the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as x. 

Step 1: Sold a third at the green house
Vacuum cleaners left after selling at the green house = x - (1/3)x = (2/3)x

Step 2: Sold 2 more at the red house
Vacuum cleaners left after selling at the red house = (2/3)x - 2

Step 3: Sold half of what was left at the orange house
Equation: (1/2)((2/3)x - 2) = 5
Solving the equation, we get x = 24

Therefore, Melanie started with 24 vacuum cleaners.

There are 16 x 25/100 = <<16*25/100=4>>4 students who enrolled in jazz dance.
Hence, 16 - 4 = <<16-4=12>>12 students enrolled in hip-hop dance.
This is 12/20 x 100% = 60% of the entire students.

[2024-12-31 14:22:21,437][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: First, let's determine the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance. 20% of 20 students is 4 students.

Next, let's find the number of students who did not enroll in contemporary dance. There are 20 - 4 = 16 students remaining.

25% of the remaining students enrolled in jazz dance. 25% of 16 students is 4 students.

Therefore, the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is 16 - 4 = 12 students.

Since there are 20 students in total, the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is 12/20 * 100% = 60%.

[2024-12-31 14:22:26,154][INFO] [Judge] [Truth]: First find the total amount Jill makes per week teaching: $20/hour * 35 hours/week = $<<20*35=700>>700/week
Then find the total amount Jill makes per week coaching: $30/hour * 15 hours/week = $<<30*15=450>>450/week
Then add those two amounts to find the total amount Jill makes per week: $700/week + $450/week = $<<700+450=1150>>1150/week
Then multiply that number by the number of weeks Jill works in a year to find her annual salary: $1150/week * 50 weeks/year = $<<1150*50=57500>>57,500
#### 57500
[2024-12-31 14:22:26,154][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: First, let's calculate the annual salary Jill earns as a teacher. 

Teacher's hourly rate: $20
Weekly hours as a teacher: 35
Weekly salary as a teacher: $20/hour * 35 hours = $700
Annual salary as a teacher: $700/week * 50 weeks = $35,000

Secondly, let's determine the annual salary Jill earns as a cheerleading coach.

Coach's hourly rate: $30
Weekly hours as a coach: 15
Weekly salary as a coach: $30/hour * 15 hours = $450
Annual salary as a coach: $450/week * 50 weeks = $22,500

Finally, let's find Jill's total annual salary by summing up her earnings as a teacher and cheerleading coach.

Total annual salary: $35,000 (teacher) + $22,500 (coach) = $57,500

The answer: 57500.

[2024-12-31 14:22:28,011][INFO] [Judge] [Truth]: She eats 3 eggs every day and there are 7 days in a week so she eats 3*7 = <<3*7=21>>21 eggs a week
After 4 weeks she will have eaten 4*21 = <<4*21=84>>84 eggs
There are 12 eggs in 1 dozen and she'll eat 84 eggs so that's 84/12 = <<84/12=7>>7 dozen eggs
#### 7
[2024-12-31 14:22:28,011][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: To find out how many dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we first need to calculate how many eggs she will consume in a week. 

Given that she eats a 3 egg omelet every morning, she will consume 3 eggs x 7 days = 21 eggs per week. 

Now, to find out how many dozens that is, we divide by 12 (the number of eggs in a dozen): 21 eggs / 12 = 1.75 dozens. 

Since we are looking at 4 weeks, we multiply the weekly consumption by 4: 1.75 dozens x 4 weeks = 7 dozens. 

Therefore, Claire will eat 7 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks. 

The answer: 7.

Next subtract the time Marissa already spent walking to find out how much time she has left: 3 hours - 1 hour - 1 hour = <<3-1-1=1>>1 hour
Now figure out how much distance she has left by subtracting the distance she already traveled from the total distance: 12 miles - 4 miles - 2 miles = <<12-4-2=6>>6 miles
Now divide the remaining distance by the remaining time to find out how fast in miles per hour Marissa has to travel: 6 miles / 1 hour = <<6/1=6>>6 mph
#### 6
[2024-12-31 14:22:29,734][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: First, let's find the total time Marissa spent on the first 6 miles of the trail: 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours.
Her average speed on the first 6 miles was 6 miles / 2 hours = 3 miles per hour.
To cover the remaining 6 miles at an average speed of 4 miles per hour, she should take 6 miles / 4 miles per hour = 1.5 hours.
So, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of 6 miles / 1.5 hours = 4 miles per hour.
The answer: 4.

After 1 liter of orange drink was spilled, there were 10 - 1 = <<10-1=9>>9 liters of orange drink left.
Out of the 9 liters, 9 x 2/3 = <<9*2/3=6>>6 liters are water.
Thus, there are a total of 9 + 6 = <<9+6=15>>15 liters of water out of the 24 liters.
#### 15
[2024-12-31 14:22:31,495][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: First, let's calculate the water content in the 10 liters of orange drink:
10 liters * 2/3 = 20/3 liters of water in the orange drink.

Next, let's calculate the water content in the 15 liters of pineapple drink:
15 liters * 3/5 = 9 liters of water in the pineapple drink.

After spilling 1 liter of the orange drink, there are 9 liters of orange drink left.

Therefore, the total water content in the remaining 24 liters is:
9 liters (from the orange drink) + 9 liters (from the pineapple drink) = 18 liters of water.

The answer: 18.

[2024-12-31 14:22:36,617][INFO] [Judge] [Truth]: Let X be the original price of the book. The discounted price is X - X*25% = $19.50.
Combining like terms, we get .75X = $19.50
Dividing both sides by .75, we get X = $26.
#### 26
[2024-12-31 14:22:36,617][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: To find the original price of the book, we need to first calculate what the 25% discount was. 

Let x be the original price. 
25% of x is 0.25*x. 
So, after the discount, the price Kyle paid is x - 0.25*x = $19.50. 

Solving the equation, 
0.75x = $19.50
x = $19.50 / 0.75 = $26.

Therefore, the original price of the book was $26. 

The answer: 26.

Four apples cost $1.50 x 4 = $<<1.5*4=6>>6.
The total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples is $12 + $15 + $6 = $<<12+15+6=33>>33.
Thus, the boxes of pizza cost $50 - $33 = $<<50-33=17>>17.
Therefore, Marie ordered $17/$8.50 = <<17/8.5=2>>2 boxes of pizza.
#### 2
[2024-12-31 14:22:38,644][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Marie ordered:
- Chicken meal: $12
- 5 packs of milk at $3 each: 5 x $3 = $15
- 4 apples at $1.50 each: 4 x $1.50 = $6
- Let the number of pizza boxes be x for now: x * $8.50
Adding up all these costs gives the total amount Marie paid which is $50. So, the equation to solve becomes:
$12 + $15 + $6 + $8.50x = $50
Solving for x:
$33 + $8.50x = $50
$8.50x = $17
x = $17 / $8.50
x = 2
Therefore, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza.
The answer: 2.

If each carton costs $4.00 and she needs 4 containers then it will cost her 4*4 = $<<4*4=16.00>>16.00
#### 16
[2024-12-31 14:22:41,868][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: First, we need to find out how many cartons of ice cream Cynthia will need in 60 days. Since she eats one serving of ice cream every night for 60 days, she will need 60 servings in total. Since each carton has 15 servings, she will need 60/15 = 4 cartons of ice cream. 

Next, we calculate the total cost of these 4 cartons. Each carton costs $4.00, so 4 cartons will cost 4 * 4 = $16.00.

Therefore, after 60 days, Cynthia will spend $16.00 on ice cream.

Henry traveled 60 miles - 35 miles = <<60-35=25>>25 miles between his first and second stop.
#### 25
[2024-12-31 14:22:43,674][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: To find the distance between the two stops, we need to calculate the total distance traveled between the first stop and the second stop. 

Henry traveled 20 miles from the start to his first stop, then he traveled 15 miles from his second stop to the end of his trip. 

So, the distance between his first stop and his second stop would be:
Total distance - (20 miles + 15 miles)

This equals: 60 miles - (20 miles + 15 miles) 
This simplifies to: 60 miles - 35 miles 
Therefore, the distance between his first and second stops is 25 miles.

The heels together cost 66 + 33 = $<<66+33=99>>99.
The boots cost $5 more than both pairs of heels together, so the boots cost 99 + 5 = $104.
#### 104
[2024-12-31 14:22:45,367][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: First, let's denote the cost of the boots as B, the cost of the cheaper pair of high heels as H1, and the cost of the more expensive pair of high heels as H2. 

We are given that H1 = $33 and H2 = 2*H1 = $66. 

We know that the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is $33 + $66 = $99.

According to the problem, the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is $5 dollars less than the cost of the boots, so we have:

B = $99 + $5 = $104.

Therefore, the boots cost $104.

The answer: 104.

Darrell's age = 7 parts * 9 = 63 
Allen's age = 11 parts * 9 = 99. 

Finally, to find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age: 99 + 10 = 109.

2. The second friend guessed 20 more than half of the first guess, which would be 20 + (80/2) = 60 jelly beans.
3. The third friend guessed 25% more than the first guess, which would be 80 + 0.25*80 = 80 + 20 = 100 jelly beans.

To find the average guess, we will add up the guesses and divide by the number of friends (3) to get (80 + 60 + 100) / 3 = 240 / 3 = 80 jelly beans.

[2024-12-31 14:22:51,781][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: First, let's represent the number of silver coins as x. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins is x+30. 

Next, we can create an equation based on the given information: x + (x+30) = 110 (total number of coins)

By solving the equation: 2x + 30 = 110, we find that 2x = 80. 
Hence, x = 40 (number of silver coins) and x+30 = 70 (number of gold coins). 

Therefore, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

[2024-12-31 14:22:54,653][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: To find the total number of points Mike scored in the second 20 minutes, we first calculate 25% more points than he scored in the first 20 minutes. 

25% of 4 points is 1, so in the second 20 minutes, Mike scored an additional 1 point compared to the first 20 minutes. 

Therefore, in the second 20 minutes, he scored 4 + 1 = 5 points. 

Thus, he scored a total of 4 (from the first 20 minutes) + 5 (from the second 20 minutes) = 9 points in 40 minutes.

The yogurt is sold as 4 units for $5.00 and he needs 60 yogurts so thatâ€™s 60/4 = <<60/4=15>>15 4-packs
Each 4-pack is $5.00 and he needs 15 4-packs so he will spend $5*15 = $<<5*15=75.00>>75.00 on yogurt
#### 75
[2024-12-31 14:22:56,129][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: First, let's calculate how much Terry spends on yogurt each day. Since 4 yogurts cost $5.00, each yogurt costs $5.00 / 4 = $1.25.

So, Terry spends $1.25 x 2 = $2.50 on yogurt each day.

Over 30 days, Terry spends $2.50 x 30 = $75.00 on yogurt.

The answer: 75.

[2024-12-31 14:22:58,761][INFO] [Judge] [Truth]: He spent $160 on video games because 8 x 20 = <<8*20=160>>160
He earned $165 from his sale because 160 + 5 = <<160+5=165>>165
He sold 11 lego sets because 11 x 15 = <<11*15=165>>165
He has 2 sets left because 13 - 11 = <<13-11=2>>2
#### 2
[2024-12-31 14:22:58,762][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: To find out how much money John made by selling the Lego sets, we multiply the number of Lego sets (13) by the selling price per set ($15), which gives us 13 * 15 = $195. 
Next, we find out how much money John spent on the video games by multiplying the number of games (8) by the price per game ($20), which gives us 8 * 20 = $160. 
Subtracting the total amount spent on the video games from the money made selling the Lego sets, we have $195 - $160 = $35. 
Since John has $5 left, he must have spent $35 - $5 = $30 on something else. 

Let X be the number of Lego sets he still has. Since each Lego set costs $15, the remaining Lego sets would be worth $15 * X. 
To solve for X, we set up the equation: $15 * X = $30, which simplifies to X = $30 / $15 = 2.

Therefore, John still has 2 Lego sets left. 
The answer: 2.

[2024-12-31 14:23:01,309][INFO] [Judge] [Truth]: He has 7-1=<<7-1=6>>6 possible running days.
He runs half of those so he runs 6/2=<<6/2=3>>3 days.
So for two days, he runs 3/2=<<3/2=1.5>>1.5 hours.
So in total, he runs 3+1.5+1.5=<<3+1.5+1.5=6>>6 hours.
So he runs 60/6=<<60/6=10>>10 mph.
#### 10
[2024-12-31 14:23:01,309][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: First, let's calculate how many miles he runs each day on average.
Total miles per week = 60
Total days he runs = 3
Average miles per day = Total miles per week / Total days he runs
Average miles per day = 60 / 3 = 20 miles per day

Now, let's calculate how many miles he runs the first day.
Miles ran first day = 20 miles

Next, let's calculate how many miles he runs the other two days.
Miles ran the other two days = 20 / 2 = 10 miles each day

Now, let's calculate his average speed.
Total hours first day = 3 hours
Total hours other two days = 3 hours

Total time spent running = 3 hours + 3 hours = 6 hours

Average speed = Total miles / Total hours
Average speed = (20 + 10 + 10) / 6 = 40 / 6 = 6.67 miles per hour

So, John runs at a speed of 6.67 miles per hour.

The answer: 6.67.

[2024-12-31 14:23:03,352][INFO] [Judge] [Truth]: If Dana can skip at half the speed she can run, then she can run at 3*2=<<3*2=6>>6 miles per hour.
And since she can run at a speed that is 4 times faster than she can walk, this means she can walk at 6/4=1.5 miles per hour.
If two-thirds of the time is spent walking, then she walks for 6*(2/3)=<<6*(2/3)=4>>4 hours.
If one-third of the time is spent running, then she runs for 6-4=<<6-4=2>>2 hours.
Thus, she runs for 2 hours at 6 miles per hour, or 2*6=<<2*6=12>>12 miles.
She walks for 4 hours at 1.5 miles per hour, or 4*1.5=<<4*1.5=6>>6 miles.
Thus, altogether, she travels 12+6=<<12+6=18>>18 miles.
#### 18
[2024-12-31 14:23:03,352][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: First, if Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour, then she can run at 6 miles per hour (since skipping is half as fast as running) and walk at 1.5 miles per hour (since running is four times faster than walking).

Next, if Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds walking out of total six hours, she spends 2 hours running and 4 hours walking. 

When running at 6 miles per hour, Dana can cover 2 hours * 6 mph = 12 miles. When walking at 1.5 miles per hour, Dana can cover 4 hours * 1.5 mph = 6 miles.

Therefore, Dana can travel a total of 12 + 6 = 18 miles in six hours.

The answer: 18.

Next, we know that 14 pieces of pie were left at the end of the evening. So, if we subtract the remaining pieces from the total pieces, we can find out how many pieces were taken by the guests. 
40 - 14 = 26 pieces were taken by the guests.

If each serving of chips has 250 calories and I only have 200 calories left to eat, then I can only eat 200/250 of a serving = 4/5 of a serving
We also know that a 300g bag of chips has 5 servings, hence each serving has 300g/5 = <<300/5=60>>60 grams
If I can only eat 4/5 of a serving, then I can eat only 60g * 4/5 = 240g/5 = 48 grams
#### 48
[2024-12-31 14:23:09,658][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: To find out how many grams of chips you can eat, we first need to determine how many calories are left in your daily target after consuming 1800 calories. 

Daily calorie target: 2000 calories
Calories consumed: 1800 calories
Calories left: 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories

Now, we need to calculate how many servings of chips you can have based on the remaining calories:

Calories per serving: 250 calories
Calories left: 200 calories
Servings you can have: 200 / 250 = 0.8 servings

Since you can't have a fraction of a serving, you can have at most 0 servings from the bag. Therefore, the grams you can eat would be 0 grams.

The answer: 0.

He wants to sell each candle for $2.00 each and he's selling 20 candles so that's 2*20 = $<<2*20=40.00>>40.00
If he makes $40.00 selling candles and his supplies cost $20.00 then his net profit is 40-20 = $<<40-20=20.00>>20.00
#### 20
[2024-12-31 14:23:11,674][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: First, let's determine how many candles Charlie can make from 1 pound of beeswax. Since he can make 10 tapered candles per pound, Charlie can make 10 candles from 1 pound. 

Next, let's calculate the total cost of supplies for making 20 candles. One pound of beeswax and wicks cost $10.00, so the total cost of supplies for making 20 candles will be $10.00. 

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles. If each candle is sold for $2.00, then the total revenue from selling 20 candles will be 20 x $2.00 = $40.00.

To find the net profit, we need to subtract the total cost of supplies from the total revenue. Therefore, the net profit will be $40.00 - $10.00 = $30.00.

Then, the total number of post-it notes she had when she left the store was 80+x.
And if she used 220 Post-it notes at work and had 23 left, then 80+x=220+23
Subtracting 80 from each side of the equation, we see that x=220+23-80=<<220+23-80=163>>163 Post-it notes.
#### 163
[2024-12-31 14:23:15,286][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: First, we need to find out how many post-it notes Candice had in total before placing them on the cups of coffee. 
Candice had 80 post-it notes in her purse + the number of post-it notes in the package she purchased.

After placing post-it notes on cups of coffee, she had 23 post-it notes remaining. 

The total number of post-it notes she had before placing them on cups of coffee is 80 + x (number of post-it notes from the package).

She placed post-it notes on 220 cups of coffee.

So 80 + x - 220 = 23.

So they each cost $40 + $20 = $<<40+20=60>>60
So he spent $60 * 10 = $<<60*10=600>>600 on red ties
So he spent $200 + $600 = $<<200+600=800>>800 on ties

[2024-12-31 14:23:26,651][INFO] [Judge] [Truth]: On Thursday the mechanic charged a total of 6*60 + 4*40 = $<<6*60+4*40=520>>520.
On Friday the mechanic charged a total of 12*40 = $<<12*40=480>>480.
Thus, on Thursday, the day with higher revenue, the mechanic had 520-480 = $<<520-480=40>>40 more revenue than on Friday.
#### 40
[2024-12-31 14:23:26,651][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: First, let's calculate the revenue for each day. 
On Thursday:
Revenue from truck tire repairs: 6 truck tires * $60 = $360
Revenue from car tire repairs: 4 car tires * $40 = $160
Total revenue on Thursday: $360 + $160 = $520

On Friday:
Revenue from car tire repairs: 12 car tires * $40 = $480
Total revenue on Friday: $480

The mechanic earned more revenue on Friday. 
To find out how much more revenue the mechanic earned on Friday than Thursday: 
Revenue on Friday - Revenue on Thursday = $480 - $520 = -$40
So, the mechanic earned $40 more revenue on Thursday than on Friday.

The answer: 40.

[2024-12-31 14:23:28,112][INFO] [Judge] [Truth]: Patchy has just had 3 * 7 = <<3*7=21>>21 kittens
Since Trixie's kittens are 12, both cats have 21 +12 = <<21+12=33>>33 kittens.
Combining the adopted kittens with those from the two cats, the Doubtfire family now has 7 + 33 = <<7+33=40>>40 kittens.
#### 40
[2024-12-31 14:23:28,112][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: First, we need to find out how many kittens Patchy has had. Since Trixie has had 12 kittens and Patchy has had thrice the number of adopted kittens (7), Patchy has had 7 * 3 = 21 kittens.
Now, to find out the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family has, we add the number of kittens from both cats: 21 (from Patchy) + 12 (from Trixie) = 33 kittens.
Therefore, the Doubtfire family now has 33 kittens. 
The answer: 33.

There can be 1245 / 15 = <<1245/15=83>>83 boxes loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit.
#### 83
[2024-12-31 14:23:32,904][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: First, we need to calculate the weight of the truck without any boxes: 
Weight of the driver and empty truck = 3755 pounds
Weight limit of the bridge = 5000 pounds
Weight of the empty truck = 3755 pounds
Weight that can be added to the truck = 5000 - 3755 = 1245 pounds

Next, we need to divide the maximum amount of weight that can be added to the truck by the weight of each box to find out the maximum number of boxes:
Weight of each box = 15 pounds
Maximum weight that can be added to the truck = 1245 pounds
Maximum number of boxes = 1245 / 15 = 83

Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit is 83.
The answer: 83.

There is also a $3.00 delivery fee and a $4.00 tip for an extra $3 + $4 = $<<3+4=7.00>>7.00 in fees
His groceries were $40.00, there's a $10.00 fee plus another $7.00 in delivery/tip fees for a final total of $40 + $10 + $7 = $<<40+10+7=57.00>>57.00
#### 57
[2024-12-31 14:23:34,721][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: To find the final price of Stephen's groceries, we need to subtract the fee and delivery charge from the total amount. 

The fee for the groceries is 25% of $40.00, which is $10.00. 
Adding the delivery fee of $3.00, the total extra fees amount to $13.00. 
So, the total amount before any extra charges is $40.00 - $13.00 = $27.00. 
Finally, after adding the tip of $4.00, the final price of Stephen's groceries is $27.00 + $4.00 = $31.00. 

The answer: 31.

#### 17
[2024-12-31 14:23:37,188][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: To find out how many oranges are good, let's first calculate the number of oranges that are bad, unripe, and sour.
1 bad orange + 20% unripe oranges (5 oranges) + 2 sour oranges = 1 + 5 + 2 = 8 oranges that are not good.

Now, subtracting these 8 oranges from the total number of oranges gives the number of good oranges:
Total oranges - Not good oranges = Good oranges
25 - 8 = 17

Therefore, there are 17 good oranges in the basket.
The answer: 17.

Then multiply that number by the amount of her pension she gets per year: 10 years * 5% = 50%
Then multiply that percentage by the total amount of the full pension to find how much she gets: $50,000 * 50% = $<<50000*50*.01=25000>>25,000
#### 25000
[2024-12-31 14:23:40,583][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: First, let's calculate the additional pension Marcy will receive after 20 years of working in the company. 

5% of $50,000 = $2,500

Next, let's find out how many years Marcy will receive the additional pension before she quits after 30 years of working:

30 years - 20 years = 10 years

Now, let's calculate the total additional pension Marcy will receive over the 10 years:

$2,500 * 10 years = $25,000

Finally, let's sum up Marcy's annual pension plus the additional pension over the 10 years:

$50,000 + $25,000 = $75,000

Therefore, Marcy's annual pension when she quits after 30 years will be $75,000/year.

For the first six months, the streaming service charged her a total of 6*140 = $<<6*140=840>>840
For the next half of the year, the streaming service company charged her 10/100*140 = $<<10/100*140=14>>14 less
She paid $140-$14 = $<<140-14=126>>126 each month for the remaining half of the year,
In total, she paid 126*6 = $<<126*6=756>>756 for the other half of the year for the streaming service.
The total amount of money she paid at the end of the year is $840+$756 = $<<840+756=1596>>1596
#### 1596
[2024-12-31 14:23:42,037][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: First, let's calculate the total amount Aleena pays in a year. 
For the first half of the year, she pays $140/month for 6 months, so 140 * 6 = $840.
For the second half of the year, she gets a 10% discount, which means she will pay 140 - 0.10 * 140 = $126/month. 
So, for the remaining 6 months, she pays 126 * 6 = $756. 
Adding the amounts for the first and second half of the year, she paid a total of 840 + 756 = $1596.
Therefore, Aleena paid a total of $1596 for the streaming service by the end of the year.

So, each cell phone costs $150 + $3 = $<<150+3=153>>153.
The total amount to be paid for 5 cell phones is $153 x 5 = $<<153*5=765>>765.
Thus, Shiela will pay $765/3 = $<<765/3=255>>255 each month.
#### 255
[2024-12-31 14:23:57,210][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: First, let's calculate the total cost of the five cell phones: 5 cell phones * $150 each = $750 total cost. 

Next, let's calculate the total interest for the installment plan: $750 total cost * 2% interest = $15 total interest.

Then, let's add the total cost and the total interest to get the final amount Shiela will pay: $750 total cost + $15 total interest = $765.

Finally, to find out how much Shiela will pay each month for 3 months, we divide the total amount by the number of months: $765 total amount / 3 months = $255 each month.

The answer: 255.

Level 1 is 128 square feet because 64 x 2 = <<64*2=128>>128
The four levels total to 240 square feet because 128 + 64 + 32 + 16 = <<128+64+32+16=240>>240
The average square footage of a level is 60 because 240 / 4 = <<240/4=60>>60
#### 60
[2024-12-31 14:24:00,330][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: To find the average square footage of a level, we need to calculate the square footage of each level and then find the average. Given that the top level has a square footage of 16 and each level below it will have half the square footage of the level above it, the square footage of each level starting from the top would be: 16, 8, 4, 2. 

To find the average, we add up the square footage of all levels and then divide by the total number of levels. 
Average = (16 + 8 + 4 + 2) / 4 = 30 / 4 = 7.5.

#### 5
[2024-12-31 14:24:02,380][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: First, let's calculate the total amount of dog food needed for the first 180 days. Cecilia needs 1 cup/day * 180 days = 180 cups of dog food for the first 180 days.

Then, let's calculate the total amount of dog food needed for the rest of the year. After the first 180 days, Cecilia needs 2 cups/day * (365 days - 180 days) = 2 cups/day * 185 days = 370 cups of dog food.

Next, let's add up the total amount of dog food needed for the year: 180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups of dog food.

Finally, let's determine the number of bags of dog food Cecilia will need: 550 cups / 110 cups/bag = 5 bags of dog food.

[2024-12-31 14:24:06,492][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: Vincent should buy the flowers in packages of 3 for $2.50 because it's the better deal. 
So, by buying in packages of 3, Vincent spends $2.50 for 3 flowers, which means each flower costs $2.50/3 = $0.83.
If he buys 18 flowers, he would spend $0.83 * 18 = $14.94 in total.
However, if he bought 18 flowers in packages of 2 for $1 each, he would spend $1 * 18 = $18.
Therefore, Vincent saves $18 - $14.94 = $3.06 by buying in packages of 3.

The number of wins is L + <<+8=8>>8.
The team played (L+8) + L = 2L + 8 = 22 games.
So, 2L = 22 - 8 = 14
So L = 14/2 = <<14/2=7>>7 losses.
Therefore, the team won 22 â€“ 7 = <<22-7=15>>15 games.
#### 15
[2024-12-31 14:24:15,493][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: First, let's set up the equation to represent the given information:
Let W represent the number of games they won.
Let L represent the number of games they lost.
We know that W = L + 8
And the total number of games played is 22, so W + L = 22
Now substitute the value of W from the first equation into the second equation:
(L + 8) + L = 22
2L + 8 = 22
2L = 14
L = 7
Now, substitute the value of L back into W = L + 8
W = 7 + 8
W = 15
Therefore, the football team won 15 games.

#### 9360
[2024-12-31 14:24:20,105][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: To calculate Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to first find her current annual salary. Since she just reached 5 years in the company last December, her current annual salary is $600 + 10% of $600 for every year she has been with the company. 

After 5 years:
$600 + 0.10 * $600 = $600 + $60 = $660

After 6 years:
$660 + 10% of $660 = $660 + $66 = $726

After 7 years:
$726 + 10% of $726 = $726 + $72.60 = $798.60

Therefore, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service would be $798.60.

Then Marilyn sold 10x copies.
The total number of copies sold is x + 10x = 88,000.
Combining like terms, we get 11x = 88,000.
Dividing both sides by 11, we find x = 8,000.
Therefore, Harald sold 8,000 copies.

#### 24
[2024-12-31 14:24:22,945][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: First, we need to account for the 1/4 of attendees that won't show up. If 1/4 don't show up, that means she actually expects 3/4 of the invited guests to show up. So, 16 friends invited * 3/4 = 12 friends expected to attend.

Next, she needs .75 gift bags per invited guest. So, 12 friends * .75 gift bags each = 9 gift bags needed.

Each gift bag costs $2, so 9 gift bags * $2 per bag = $18 total.

[2024-12-31 14:24:24,230][INFO] [Judge] [Truth]: Half of 10 pounds is 10/2=<<10/2=5>>5 pounds.
To feed 20 dinosaur adults, he will need 20*10=<<20*10=200>>200 pounds of potato salad.
To feed 5 dinosaur children, he will need 5*5=<<5*5=25>>25 pounds of potato salad.
In total, he will need to bring 200+25=<<200+25=225>>225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic.
#### 225
[2024-12-31 14:24:24,230][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: First, let's calculate the total amount of potato salad the adults will eat: 
20 adults * 10 lbs = 200 lbs.

Next, let's calculate the total amount of potato salad the children will eat:
5 children * (10 lbs / 2) = 25 lbs.

Now, let's add the total amount of potato salad that both the adults and children will eat: 
200 lbs + 25 lbs = 225 lbs.

Therefore, Ted needs to bring 225 lbs of potato salad to the picnic. 

The answer: 225.

[2024-12-31 14:24:25,627][INFO] [Judge] [Truth]: Marcia has 4 + 2 = <<4+2=6>>6 pets.
Jan has 3 * 6 = <<3*6=18>>18 pets
In total, the three have 4 + 6 + 18 = <<4+6+18=28>>28 pets.
#### 28
[2024-12-31 14:24:25,627][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: First, let's find out how many pets Marcia has. Since Cindy has four pets, Marcia has 4+2=6 pets.
Next, let's find out how many pets Jan has. Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, so Jan has 3*6=18 pets.
Now, let's calculate the total number of pets the three have. The total number of pets they have is 4 (Cindy) + 6 (Marcia) + 18 (Jan) = 28 pets.
The answer: 28.

[2024-12-31 14:24:26,923][INFO] [Judge] [Truth]: James is 10 and 1 year younger than Corey, so Corey is 10 + 1 = <<10+1=11>>11 years old
Amy is 2 years younger than Corey so is 11 - 2 = 9 years old
Amy is also 5 years older than Jackson, so Jackson is 9 - 5 = <<9-5=4>>4 years old
#### 4
[2024-12-31 14:24:26,924][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: Amy is Jackson + 5 years old and Corey is Amy + 2 years old. Therefore, Corey is Jackson + 7 years old. Since James is 10 and 1 year younger than Corey, Corey is 11 years old. Jackson is Corey - 7 years old. Thus, Jackson is 4 years old. The answer: 4.

[2024-12-31 14:24:28,597][INFO] [Judge] [Truth]: If Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, which was two seconds faster than Gerald used to run the 400-meter hurdles, then Gerald initially would run the 400-meter hurdles in 38+2=<<38+2=40>>40 seconds.
10% of 40 seconds is 40*0.1=<<40*0.1=4>>4 seconds.
The improved diet reduced Gerald's race time to 40-4=<<40-4=36>>36 seconds.
#### 36
[2024-12-31 14:24:28,597][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: Let's calculate how fast Lee used to run the 400-meter hurdles first:
Lee runs the hurdles 2 seconds faster than Gerald.
If Lee runs in 38 seconds, then Gerald must run in 38 + 2 = 40 seconds.

Now, let's calculate Gerald's speed after the diet improvement:
With a 10% increase in speed, Gerald's new time will be 40 seconds * 0.9 = 36 seconds.

Therefore, with his improved diet, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds.
The answer: 36.

[2024-12-31 14:24:30,431][INFO] [Judge] [Truth]: If there are two cats for every dog, and the number of dogs is 60, the number of cats is 2*60 = <<2*60=120>>120
The combined number of cats and dogs is 120+60 = <<120+60=180>>180
The number of rabbits pets is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats, a total of 180-12 = 168
The total number of pets in the compound is 168+180 = <<168+180=348>>348
#### 348
[2024-12-31 14:24:30,432][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: First, we know that the number of rabbits is 12 less than the combined number of dogs and cats. Since there are 60 dogs, the number of cats would be 2 * 60 = 120. So, the combined number of dogs and cats is 60 + 120 = 180. Therefore, the number of rabbits is 180 - 12 = 168. To find the total number of pets, we sum all the animals: 60 (dogs) + 120 (cats) + 168 (rabbits) = 348 pets in total. 
The answer: 348.

[2024-12-31 14:24:31,891][INFO] [Judge] [Truth]: There are 200 x 2/5 = <<200*2/5=80>>80 boys in Grade 5.
So, 200 - 80 = <<200-80=120>>120 are girls.
Out of the 120 girls, 120 x 2/3 = <<120*2/3=80>>80 are in the girl scout.
Therefore, 120 - 80 = <<120-80=40>>40 girls are not in the girl scout.
#### 40
[2024-12-31 14:24:31,891][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: First, let's find how many boys there are: 

200 students * 2/5 = 80 boys

Next, let's find how many girls there are:
200 students - 80 boys = 120 girls

Then, let's find how many girls are in the girl scout:
120 girls * 2/3 = 80 girls in the girl scout

Now, let's find how many girls are not in the girl scout:
120 girls - 80 girls = 40 girls not in the girl scout

Therefore, there are 40 girls not in the girl scout. The answer: 40.

[2024-12-31 14:24:36,371][INFO] [Judge] [Truth]: Tomatoes lose half their volume when made into sauce, so Freda started with 32 * 2 = <<32*2=64>>64 ounces of tomatoes.
At 16 ounces per can, she used 64 / 16 = <<64/16=4>>4 cans of tomatoes.
At 3 tomatoes a can, Freda used 3 * 4 = <<3*4=12>>12 tomatoes.
#### 12
[2024-12-31 14:24:36,371][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: Let's break it down step by step:

1. Since the tomatoes lose half of their volume when cooked into sauce, the starting volume of tomatoes used would be double the final volume of sauce. This means that Freda when made 32 ounces of sauce, she used 64 ounces of canned tomatoes.

2. If each 16 ounce can contains three tomatoes, then each tomato weighs 16/3 = 5.33 ounces.

3. To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we divide the total weight of tomatoes used (64 ounces) by the weight of each tomato (5.33 ounces), which gives us 64/5.33 = 12 tomatoes.

Therefore, Freda used 12 tomatoes. 

The answer: 12.

[2024-12-31 14:24:39,515][INFO] [Judge] [Truth]: The cars that exited do not need to be included so there were 30 original cars â€“ 5 cars that exited = <<30-5=25>>25 cars that drove through the traffic jam.
Most of the cars exited in the final 15 minutes so in the first 15 minutes, there must have been 25 total cars â€“ 20 cars that drove through in the final 15 minutes = 5 cars that drove through the traffic jam.
#### 5
[2024-12-31 14:24:39,515][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: Let's solve this step by step:

1. If there were originally 30 cars on the motorway, and 5 cars took an exit, then there were 30 - 5 = 25 cars remaining on the motorway.
2. We know that in the first 15 minutes, some cars drove through and then 20 more cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes. Let's denote the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes as x. Therefore, the total number of cars that drove through in 15 minutes would be x + 20.
3. Since the total number of cars that drove through is equal to the remaining cars on the motorway (25), we can set up an equation: x + (x + 20) = 25.
4. Solving the equation: 2x + 20 = 25, 2x = 5, x = 2.5.
5. Since we can't have a fraction of a car, we conclude that 2 cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.

The answer: 2.
