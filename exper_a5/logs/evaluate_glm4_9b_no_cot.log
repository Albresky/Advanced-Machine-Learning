[2024-12-31 15:24:56,739][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: Janet sells 16 - 3 - 4 = <<16-3-4=9>>9 duck eggs a day.
She makes 9 * 2 = $<<9*2=18>>18 every day at the farmerâ€™s market.
#### 18
[2024-12-31 15:24:56,739][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
First, let's calculate the total number of eggs laid by the ducks each day:

16 eggs/day

Next, let's calculate the number of eggs used for Janet's breakfast and muffins for her friends:

Breakfast: 3 eggs/day
Muffins: 4 eggs/day

Total eggs used for breakfast and muffins:
3 eggs (breakfast) + 4 eggs (muffins) = 7 eggs/day

Now, let's calculate the number of eggs left to sell at the farmers' market:

Total eggs laid - Eggs used for breakfast and muffins:
16 eggs/day - 7 eggs/day = 9 eggs/day

Finally, let's calculate the amount of money Janet makes every day at the farmers' market:

Number of eggs left to sell * Price per egg:
9 eggs/day * $2/egg = $18/day

The answer: 18.

[2024-12-31 15:25:01,547][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: It takes 2/2=<<2/2=1>>1 bolt of white fiber
So the total amount of fabric is 2+1=<<2+1=3>>3 bolts of fabric
#### 3
[2024-12-31 15:25:01,548][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
To determine the total number of bolts needed for the robe, we need to calculate the amount of each type of fiber required and then convert that into bolts.

The robe requires:
- 2 bolts of blue fiber
- Half that much white fiber, which is 2 bolts / 2 = 1 bolt of white fiber.

Adding these together, the robe requires a total of 2 bolts (blue) + 1 bolt (white) = 3 bolts in total.

The answer: 3.

[2024-12-31 15:25:12,923][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: The cost of the house and repairs came out to 80,000+50,000=$<<80000+50000=130000>>130,000
He increased the value of the house by 80,000*1.5=<<80000*1.5=120000>>120,000
So the new value of the house is 120,000+80,000=$<<120000+80000=200000>>200,000
So he made a profit of 200,000-130,000=$<<200000-130000=70000>>70,000
#### 70000
[2024-12-31 15:25:12,923][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
To calculate the profit Josh made, we first need to determine the new value of the house after the repairs.

The value of the house increased by 150%. To find the increase, we calculate 150% of the original value of the house.

150% of $80,000 is:
(150/100) * $80,000 = 1.5 * $80,000 = $120,000

This means the value of the house increased by $120,000.

Now, we add the original value of the house to the increase in value to find the new value of the house.

New value of the house = Original value + Increase in value
New value of the house = $80,000 + $120,000
New value of the house = $200,000

Now that we have the new value of the house, we can calculate the profit Josh made.

Profit = New value of the house - Original value of the house - Cost of repairs

Profit = $200,000 - $80,000 - $50,000
Profit = $200,000 - $130,000
Profit = $70,000

The answer: 70,000.

[2024-12-31 15:25:31,114][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: If each chicken eats 3 cups of feed per day, then for 20 chickens they would need 3*20=<<3*20=60>>60 cups of feed per day.
If she feeds the flock 15 cups of feed in the morning, and 25 cups in the afternoon, then the final meal would require 60-15-25=<<60-15-25=20>>20 cups of chicken feed.
#### 20
[2024-12-31 15:25:31,114][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
To determine how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of feed given to the chickens in the morning and afternoon meals.

Morning feed: 15 cups
Afternoon feed: 25 cups

Total feed given in morning and afternoon: 15 cups + 25 cups = 40 cups

2. Calculate the total amount of feed each chicken should receive in a day.

Each chicken receives: 3 cups of feed per meal

Since there are three meals a day, the total feed per chicken per day is:

3 cups/meal * 3 meals/day = 9 cups/day per chicken

3. Calculate the total amount of feed needed for the entire flock of chickens in a day.

Total feed needed for the entire flock per day:

9 cups/day per chicken * 20 chickens = 180 cups/day for the entire flock

4. Calculate the amount of feed needed for the final meal of the day.

Since Wendi has already given her chickens 40 cups of feed in the morning and afternoon meals, we need to subtract this amount from the total feed needed for the entire flock per day.

Feed needed for the final meal:

Total feed needed for the entire flock per day - Feed given in morning and afternoon meals

180 cups/day for the entire flock - 40 cups (given in morning and afternoon meals)

140 cups

The answer: 140.

[2024-12-31 15:25:43,210][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: The discount price of one glass is 60/100 * 5 = $<<60/100*5=3>>3.
If every second glass is cheaper, that means Kylar is going to buy 16 / 2 = <<16/2=8>>8 cheaper glasses.
So for the cheaper glasses, Kylar is going to pay 8 * 3 = $<<8*3=24>>24.
And for the regular-priced glasses, Kylar will pay 8 * 5 = $<<8*5=40>>40.
So in total Kylar needs to pay 24 + 40 = $<<24+40=64>>64 for the glasses he wants to buy.
#### 64
[2024-12-31 15:25:43,210][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
To calculate the total cost for Kylar to buy 16 glasses, we need to consider the cost of each glass.

The cost of the first glass is $5.

For every second glass, the cost is 60% of the regular price. So, the cost of the second glass is 60% of $5, which is $3.

Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, we can calculate the total cost as follows:

- The cost of the first glass is $5.
- The cost of the second glass is $3.
- The cost of the third glass is $5.
- The cost of the fourth glass is $3.
- ... and so on.

We can see that the cost pattern repeats every two glasses: $5, $3, $5, $3, ...

Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of glasses by the cost of each glass.

The total cost for 16 glasses is:

(8 pairs of glasses * $5 per glass) + (8 pairs of glasses * $3 per glass))

= (8 * $5) + (8 * $3))

= $40 + $24

= $64

The answer: 64.

Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, which is 2 * 80 sheep = <<2*80=160>>160 sheep
Together, the three has 20 sheep + 160 sheep + 80 sheep = <<20+160+80=260>>260 sheep
#### 260
[2024-12-31 15:25:51,173][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
Let's break down the information given:

1. Seattle has 20 sheep.
2. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
3. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.

Now, let's calculate the number of sheep each city has:

1. Seattle has 20 sheep.
2. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.
3. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, let's add up the number of sheep in all three cities:

Seattle: 20 sheep
Charleston: 80 sheep
Toulouse: 160 sheep

Total sheep = 20 + 80 + 160 = 360 sheep

To calculate the total time it takes for Carla to download the 200 GB file, we need to consider the following:

1. The normal download speed is 2 GB/minute.
2. The file size is 200 GB.
3. A restart is forced after 40% of the download is complete.
4. The restart takes 20 minutes, and the download must restart from the beginning.

First, let's calculate the time it would take to download the file without any interruptions:

Time to download = File size / Download speed
Time to download = 200 GB / 2 GB/minute
Time to download = 100 minutes

Now, let's calculate the time it takes for the restart and the subsequent restart of the download:

Time for restart and updates = 20 minutes
Time for restart of download = 0 minutes (since it's a restart, not a new start)

Now, let's add up all the time:

Total time = Time to download + Time for restart and updates + Time for restart of download
Total time = 100 minutes + 20 minutes + 0 minutes
Total time = 120 minutes

To determine how far John is from home at the end of those 4 hours, we need to calculate the distance he traveled during each segment of his journey.

1. First leg of the journey:
   - Time: 3 hours
   - Speed: 60 mph
   - Distance: Time Ã— Speed = 3 hours Ã— 60 mph = 180 miles

2. Second leg of the journey:
   - Time: 4 hours
   - Time spent in traffic: 2 hours
   - Time spent driving at 30 mph: 0.5 hours
   - Time spent driving at 80 mph: 4 hours - 2 hours - 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours

   - Speeds and distances for each segment:
     - Traffic: 0 mph, 0 miles
     - 30 mph segment: 30 mph Ã— 0.5 hours = 15 miles
     - 80 mph segment: 80 mph Ã— 1.5 hours = 120 miles

   - Total distance for the second leg: 0 miles + 15 miles + 120 miles = 155 miles

Now, we add the distances from both legs of the journey:

- First leg distance: 180 miles
- Second leg distance: 155 miles

Total distance traveled: 180 miles + 155 miles = 335 miles

Since John turned around after driving 180 miles, he is 180 miles away from home at the end of those 4 hours.

The answer: 180.

Her hourly rate for the overtime pay is $10 x 1.2 = $<<10*1.2=12>>12.
So, Eliza will receive $12 x 5 =$<<12*5=60>>60 for overtime pay.
Her regular weekly earning is $10 x 40 = $<<10*40=400>>400.
Thus, Eliza will receive a total of $400 + $60 = $<<400+60=460>>460 for this week's work.
#### 460
[2024-12-31 15:26:27,276][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to consider both her regular pay and her overtime pay.

1. Regular Pay:
Eliza's regular hourly rate is $10. She worked for 40 hours at this rate.

Regular Pay = Hourly Rate Ã— Hours Worked
Regular Pay = $10 Ã— 40 hours
Regular Pay = $400

2. Overtime Pay:
Eliza's overtime pay rate is 1.2 times her regular hourly rate.

Overtime Pay Rate = Regular Hourly Rate Ã— Overtime Pay Multiplier
Overtime Pay Rate = $10 Ã— 1.2
Overtime Pay Rate = $12

Eliza worked 5 hours of overtime.

Overtime Pay = Overtime Pay Rate Ã— Overtime Hours Worked
Overtime Pay = $12 Ã— 5 hours
Overtime Pay = $60

3. Total Earnings:
Total Earnings = Regular Pay + Overtime Pay
Total Earnings = $400 + $60
Total Earnings = $460

The answer: 460.

To calculate the total cost, we need to multiply the number of dozens of each pastry by its respective cost per dozen, and then sum up all these amounts.

For the donuts:
3 dozen donuts at $68 per dozen.
Total cost for donuts = 3 dozen * $68/dozen = $1632

For the mini cupcakes:
2 dozen mini cupcakes at $80 per dozen.
Total cost for mini cupcakes = 2 dozen * $80/dozen = $1600

For the mini cheesecakes:
6 dozen mini cheesecakes at $55 per dozen.
Total cost for mini cheesecakes = 6 dozen * $55/dozen = $3300

Now, let's sum up all the costs:
Total cost = Cost for donuts + Cost for mini cupcakes + Cost for mini cheesecakes
Total cost = $1632 + $1600 + $3300
Total cost = $1632 + $1600 + $3300 = $7332

[2024-12-31 15:26:56,500][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
To determine how many years it will take before Carlos starts earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the costs and earnings over time.

Initial cost to plant the tree: $90

Annual costs:
- Water and feed: $3

Annual earnings:
- Selling lemons: 7 lemons/year * $1.5/lemon = $10.5/year

Now, let's calculate the net earnings each year:

Year 1:
- Earnings: $10.5
- Costs: $3
- Net earnings: $10.5 - $3 = $7.5

Year 2:
- Earnings: $10.5
- Costs: $3
- Net earnings: $10.5 - $3 = $7.5

We can see that Carlos will earn $7.5 each year after the initial cost. Since the initial cost is $90, we need to find out how many years it will take for Carlos to earn back the initial cost of $90.

To calculate this, we divide the initial cost by the net earnings per year:

$90 / $7.5/year = 12 years

Therefore, it will take Carlos 12 years before he starts earning money on the lemon tree.

The answer: 12.

Then add two to figure out how many vacuum cleaners she had before visiting the red house: 10 + 2 = <<10+2=12>>12
Now we know that 2/3 * x = 12, where x is the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with. We can find x by dividing each side of the equation by 2/3, which produces x = 18
#### 18
[2024-12-31 15:27:26,189][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. Let's call the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with "x."

2. After selling a third at the green house, Melanie has 2/3 of her original number of vacuum cleaners left. So, she has (2/3)x) vacuum cleaners left.

3. Melanie then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house. This leaves her with (2/3)x - 2) vacuum cleaners.

4. Melanie then sold half of what was left at the orange house. This means she sold (1/2) * (2/3)x - 2) vacuum cleaners at the orange house.

5. After all these sales, Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So, we can set up the following equation:

(2/3)x - 2 - (1/2) * (2/3)x - 2) = 5

Now, let's solve for x:

(2/3)x - 2 - (1/2) * (2/3)x - 2) = 5

First, let's simplify the equation by combining like terms and simplifying the fractions.

(2/3)x - 2 - (1/2) * (2/3)x - 2) = 5

Let's simplify the term (1/2) * (2/3)x - 2):

(1/2) * (2/3)x - 2) = (1/2) * (2/3)x) - (1/2) * 2

= (1/2) * (2/3)x) - 1

= (1/3)x) - 1

Now, let's substitute this simplified term back into the original equation:

(2/3)x - 2 - ((1/3)x) - 1) = 5

Now, let's simplify the equation further:

(2/3)x - 2 - (1/3)x + 1) = 5

Now, let's combine like terms:

(2/3)x - (1/3)x) - 2 - 1 = 5

Now, let's simplify the equation further:

(2/3)x - (1/3)x) - 3 = 5

Now, let's combine like terms:

(2/3)x - (1/3)x) = (2/3)x - (1/3)x) = (2/3 - 1/3)x) = (1/3)x)

Now, let's substitute this simplified term back into the equation:

(1/3)x) - 3 = 5

Now, let's isolate the variable x:

(1/3)x) = 5 + 3

(1/3)x) = 8

Now, let's solve for x:

x = 8 * 3

x = 24

So, Melanie started with 24 vacuum cleaners.

The answer: 24.

6. The rest of the students enrolled in hip-hop dance = 12 students

7. To find the percentage of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we use the formula:

   Percentage = (Number of students in hip-hop dance / Total number of students) * 100

   Percentage = (12 / 20) * 100
   Percentage = (0.6) * 100
   Percentage = 60%

The answer: 60.

[2024-12-31 15:27:46,562][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: If he purchases jewelry, he will make a profit of 2.5% which is $5000*(2.5/100) = $<<5000*(2.5/100)=125>>125
If he purchases electronic gadgets, he will make a profit of 1.2% which is $8000*(1.2/100) = $<<8000*(1.2/100)=96>>96
If he wants to maximize profit, since $125 > $96, he will choose to purchase jewelry, thereby making a profit of $<<125=125>>125
#### 125
[2024-12-31 15:27:46,562][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
To calculate the profit from each purchase plan, we need to apply the percentage increase to the initial value of each purchase plan.

For the jewelry worth $5,000 with a 2.5% increase:

Profit = Initial Value * (Percentage Increase / 100))
Profit = $5,000 * (2.5 / 100))
Profit = $5,000 * 0.025
Profit = $5,000 * 0.025
Profit = $125

For the electronic gadgets worth $8,000 with a 1.2% increase:

Profit = Initial Value * (Percentage Increase / 100))
Profit = $8,000 * (1.2 / 100))
Profit = $8,000 * 0.012
Profit = $8,000 * 0.012
Profit = $96

Comparing the profits from both purchase plans:

Jewelry profit: $125
Electronic gadgets profit: $96

The answer: 125.

[2024-12-31 15:27:54,135][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: On the first day, the trains covered 2 trains * 80 miles/train = <<2*80=160>>160 miles together.
They also covered 150 miles/train * 2 trains = <<150*2=300>>300 miles together on the second day.
The combined distance the two trains covered in the two days is 300 miles + 160 miles = <<300+160=460>>460 miles
The average distance for the two days is 460 miles / 2 trains = <<460/2=230>>230 miles/train
#### 230
[2024-12-31 15:27:54,136][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
To find the total distance covered by each train in the two days, we need to add the distances covered on each day.

On the first day, both trains travel 80 miles westward. So, the total distance covered by each train on the first day is:

80 miles (westward)

On the second day, both trains travel 150 miles northward. So, the total distance covered by each train on the second day is:

150 miles (northward)

Now, to find the total distance covered by each train over the two days, we add the distances from each day:

First day distance: 80 miles
Second day distance: 150 miles

Total distance covered by each train over the two days:

80 miles + 150 miles = 230 miles

The answer: 230.

Then find the total amount Jill makes per week coaching: $30/hour * 15 hours/week = $<<30*15=450>>450/week
Then add those two amounts to find the total amount Jill makes per week: $700/week + $450/week = $<<700+450=1150>>1150/week
Then multiply that number by the number of weeks Jill works in a year to find her annual salary: $1150/week * 50 weeks/year = $<<1150*50=57500>>57,500
#### 57500
[2024-12-31 15:28:03,925][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from teaching and cheerleading coaching separately, and then add them together.

1. Teaching earnings:
$20 per hour * 35 hours per week * 50 weeks per year

2. Cheerleading coaching earnings:
$30 per session * 15 sessions per week * 50 weeks per year

Now, let's calculate the earnings for each job:

Teaching earnings:
$20/hour * 35 hours/week * 50 weeks/year
= $20 * 35 * 50
= $350,000

Cheerleading coaching earnings:
$30/session * 15 sessions/week * 50 weeks/year
= $30 * 15 * 50
= $225,000

Now, let's add the earnings from both jobs to get her annual salary:

Annual salary = Teaching earnings + Cheerleading coaching earnings
= $350,000 + $225,000
= $575,000

The answer: 575,000.

After 4 weeks she will have eaten 4*21 = <<4*21=84>>84 eggs
There are 12 eggs in 1 dozen and she'll eat 84 eggs so that's 84/12 = <<84/12=7>>7 dozen eggs
#### 7
[2024-12-31 15:28:12,723][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
To calculate the number of dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of eggs she uses in a week.
2. Calculate the number of eggs she uses in 4 weeks.
3. Convert the total number of eggs to dozens.

Step 1: Claire makes a 3 egg omelet every morning. There are 7 days in a week, so she uses 3 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 21 eggs/week.

Step 2: In 4 weeks, she will use 21 eggs/week * 4 weeks = 84 eggs in 4 weeks.

Step 3: To convert the total number of eggs to dozens, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 (since there are 12 eggs in a dozen).

84 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 7 dozens.

The answer: 7.

[2024-12-31 15:28:27,222][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: First figure out how many hours it takes to hike a 12-mile trail at 4 mph by dividing the distance by the speed: 12 miles / 4 mph = <<12/4=3>>3 hours
Next subtract the time Marissa already spent walking to find out how much time she has left: 3 hours - 1 hour - 1 hour = <<3-1-1=1>>1 hour
Now figure out how much distance she has left by subtracting the distance she already traveled from the total distance: 12 miles - 4 miles - 2 miles = <<12-4-2=6>>6 miles
Now divide the remaining distance by the remaining time to find out how fast in miles per hour Marissa has to travel: 6 miles / 1 hour = <<6/1=6>>6 mph
#### 6
[2024-12-31 15:28:27,222][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
To find out the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance, we first need to calculate the total time she has already spent hiking.

From the information given:

- She walked the first 4 miles in 1 hour.
- She walked the next 2 miles in another hour.

So far, she has walked 6 miles in 2 hours. This means her average speed for the first 6 miles was 3 miles per hour.

Marissa wants her average speed for the entire 12-mile trail to be 4 miles per hour.

To find out how long it should take her to hike the entire 12 miles at an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 12 miles / 4 miles per hour

Time = 3 hours

This means Marissa should take a total of 3 hours to hike the entire 12-mile trail at an average speed of 4 miles per hour.

Since Marissa has already spent 2 hours hiking the first 6 miles, she has 1 hour left to hike the remaining 6 miles.

To find out the speed she needs to walk the remaining 6 miles in 1 hour, we use the formula:

Speed = Distance / Time

Speed = 6 miles / 1 hour

Speed = 6 miles per hour

Therefore, Marissa needs to walk at a speed of 6 miles per hour to complete the remaining 6 miles of the trail in 1 hour.

The answer: 6.

[2024-12-31 15:28:46,713][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: There are 15 x 3/5 = <<15*3/5=9>>9 liters of water from the 15 liters pineapple drink.
After 1 liter of orange drink was spilled, there were 10 - 1 = <<10-1=9>>9 liters of orange drink left.
Out of the 9 liters, 9 x 2/3 = <<9*2/3=6>>6 liters are water.
Thus, there are a total of 9 + 6 = <<9+6=15>>15 liters of water out of the 24 liters.
#### 15
[2024-12-31 15:28:46,713][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
First, let's calculate the amount of water in the original 10 liters of orange drink. Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, we calculate:

\( \text{Water in orange drink} = 10 \text{ liters} \times \frac{2}{3}} \)

\( \text{Water in orange drink} = 10 \times \frac{2}{3}} \)

\( \text{Water in orange drink} = \frac{20}{3}} \)

\( \text{Water in orange drink} = 6.67 \text{ liters} \)

Now, let's calculate the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink. Since the pineapple drink is three-fifths water, we calculate:

\( \text{Water in pineapple drink} = 15 \text{ liters} \times \frac{3}{5}} \)

\( \text{Water in pineapple drink} = 15 \times \frac{3}{5}} \)

\( \text{Water in pineapple drink} = 9 \text{ liters} \)

Now, let's account for the spill. Since one liter of the orange drink was spilled, we subtract one liter from the water content of the orange drink:

\( \text{Water lost in spill} = 1 \text{ liter} \)

Now, let's calculate the total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of drink. We add the water content of the remaining orange drink and the entire pineapple drink:

\( \text{Total water} = \text{Water in remaining orange drink} + \text{Water in pineapple drink}} \)

\( \text{Total water} = (6.67 - 1) + 9) \)

\( \text{Total water} = (5.67 + 9) \)

\( \text{Total water} = 14.67 + 9 \)

\( \text{Total water} = 23.67 \text{ liters} \)

The answer: 23.67.

Thus it has been 31 - 17 = <<31-17=14>>14 years since Raymond's son was born.
#### 14
[2024-12-31 15:28:56,091][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Samantha's birth year.
2. Determine Raymond's birth year.
3. Determine the birth year of Raymond's son.
4. Calculate the number of years ago Raymond's son was born.

Step 1: Samantha is now 31 years old. Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, Raymond is 31 + 6 = 37 years old.

Step 2: Since Raymond is 37 years old and he had a son at the age of 23, Raymond's son was born 37 - 23 = 14 years after Raymond's birth.

Step 3: To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to subtract the age of Raymond's son from the current year. Since we don't have the current year, we can't calculate the exact number of years ago.

#### 26
[2024-12-31 15:32:17,872][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
To find the original price of the book, we need to calculate the price before the 25% discount was applied.

Let's denote the original price as \( P \).

[2024-12-31 15:32:29,603][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: Five packs of milk cost $3 x 5 = $<<3*5=15>>15.
Four apples cost $1.50 x 4 = $<<1.5*4=6>>6.
The total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples is $12 + $15 + $6 = $<<12+15+6=33>>33.
Thus, the boxes of pizza cost $50 - $33 = $<<50-33=17>>17.
Therefore, Marie ordered $17/$8.50 = <<17/8.5=2>>2 boxes of pizza.
#### 2
[2024-12-31 15:32:29,603][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Marie ordered, excluding the pizza.

- Chicken meal: $12
- Milk packs: 5 packs * $3 each = $15
- Apples: 4 apples * $1.50 each = $6

Now, let's add up these costs:

$12 (chicken meal) + $15 (milk) + $6 (apples) = $39

Marie paid a total of $50. To find out how much was spent on pizza, we subtract the total cost of the other items from the total amount paid:

$50 (total paid) - $39 (cost of other items) = $11

Now, we know that each box of pizza costs $8.50. To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we divide the total amount spent on pizza by the cost of one box of pizza:

$11 (total spent on pizza) / $8.50 (cost of one box of pizza) â‰ˆ 1.2941

Since Marie cannot order a fraction of a box of pizza, we round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Marie ordered 1 box of pizza.

The answer: 1.

#### 243
[2024-12-31 15:32:37,173][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
To find out how much Mishka spent on all the clothing items, we need to calculate the total cost for each type of clothing and then sum these amounts.

1. Calculate the total cost for the shorts:
   3 pairs of shorts * $16.50 per pair = $49.50

2. Calculate the total cost for the pants:
   3 pairs of pants * $22.50 per pair = $67.50

3. Calculate the total cost for the shoes:
   3 pairs of shoes * $42 per pair = $126

Now, add up the total costs for each type of clothing:

$49.50 (shorts) + $67.50 (pants) + $126 (shoes) = $358

The answer: 358.

To calculate the total amount Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of servings of ice cream Cynthia consumes in 60 days.
2. Calculate the number of cartons of ice cream Cynthia needs to buy for 60 days.
3. Determine the total cost for the ice cream.

Step 1: Number of servings in 60 days
Cynthia eats 1 serving every night.
60 nights * 1 serving/night = 60 servings

Step 2: Number of cartons needed
Each carton contains 15 servings.
60 servings / 15 servings/carton = 4 cartons

Step 3: Total cost for the ice cream
Each carton costs $4.00.
4 cartons * $4.00/carton = $16.00

[2024-12-31 15:32:55,733][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: He traveled 20 miles + 15 miles = <<20+15=35>>35 miles not counting the distance between stops.
Henry traveled 60 miles - 35 miles = <<60-35=25>>25 miles between his first and second stop.
#### 25
[2024-12-31 15:32:55,733][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
To find out how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the distance Henry traveled before his first stop.
2. Calculate the distance Henry traveled between his first and second stops.
3. Calculate the distance Henry traveled after his second stop.
4. Add the distances from steps 1, 2, and 3 to find the total distance Henry traveled.

Let's calculate each step:

1. Distance before first stop = 20 miles
2. Distance between first and second stops = 15 miles
3. Distance after second stop = 60 miles (total distance) - 20 miles (distance before first stop)) - 15 miles (distance between first and second stops)) = 60 - 20 - 15 = 25 miles
4. Total distance traveled = 20 miles (distance before first stop)) + 15 miles (distance between first and second stops)) + 25 miles (distance after second stop)) = 20 + 15 + 25 = 60 miles

The answer: 60.

[2024-12-31 15:33:04,179][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: The second pair of heels costs 33 * 2 = $<<33*2=66>>66.
The heels together cost 66 + 33 = $<<66+33=99>>99.
The boots cost $5 more than both pairs of heels together, so the boots cost 99 + 5 = $104.
#### 104
[2024-12-31 15:33:04,180][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
Let's break down the information given:

1. One pair of heels costs $33.
2. The other pair of heels costs twice as much as the first pair.
3. The two pairs of high heels together cost five dollars less than the boots.

First, let's find out how much the second pair of heels costs:

The second pair of heels costs twice as much as the first pair, which costs $33.

So, the second pair of heels costs $33 * 2 = $66.

Now, let's find out the total cost of the two pairs of high heels:

The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is $33 (first pair) + $66 (second pair) = $99.

The two pairs of high heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. Therefore, the boots cost $99 + $5 = $104.

The answer: 104.

[2024-12-31 15:36:09,304][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: The total ratio representing their ages is 7+11= <<7+11=18>>18
Since the fraction of the ratio that represents Allen's age is 11/18, Allen's current age is 11/18*162 = <<11/18*162=99>>99
If Allen is currently 99 years old, in 10 years he will be 99+10 = <<99+10=109>>109 years old
#### 109
[2024-12-31 15:36:09,305][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
To solve this problem, we first need to determine the current ages of Darrell and Allen.

Let's denote Darrell's age as \( D \) and Allen's age as \( A \). According to the problem, the ratio of their ages is 7:11, so we can write:

\[ \frac{D}{A} = \frac{7}{11}} \]

We also know that the sum of their ages is 162:

\[ D + A = 162 \]

Now we have a system of two equations with two variables:

\[ \frac{D}{A} = \frac{7}{11}} \]
\[ D + A = 162 \]

We can solve this system by substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution. From the first equation, we can express \( D \) in terms of \( A \):

\[ D = \frac{7}{11}}A \]

Now we can substitute this expression for \( D \) into the second equation:

\[ \frac{7}{11}}A + A = 162 \]

To solve for \( A \), we first combine the terms on the left side of the equation:

\[ \frac{7}{11}}A + \frac{11}{11}}A = 162 \]

\[ \left(\frac{7}{11}} + \frac{11}{11}}\right)A = 162 \]

\[ \left(\frac{7}{11}} + 1\right)A = 162 \]

\[ \left(\frac{7}{11}} + \frac{11}{11}}\right)A = 162 \]

\[ \left(\frac{18}{11}}\right)A = 162 \]

\[ \frac{18}{11}}A = 162 \]

[2024-12-31 15:36:16,735][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
Let's break down the guesses:

1. The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.

2. The second friend guesses 20 more than half the first one. Half of 80 is 40. So, the second friend guesses 40 + 20 = 60 jelly beans.

3. The third friend guesses 25% more than the first one. 25% of 80 is 20. So, the third friend guesses 80 + 20 = 100 jelly beans.

Now, to find the average guess, we add up all the guesses and divide by the number of guesses.

Average guess = (80 + 60 + 100) / 3)
Average guess = (240) / 3)
Average guess = 80

The answer: 80.

#### 70
[2024-12-31 15:36:31,226][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
Let's denote the number of silver coins as S and the number of gold coins as G.

According to the problem, we have two equations:

1. The total number of coins is 110:
   S + G = 110

2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins:
   G = S + 30

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first one to solve for S:

S + (S + 30)) = 110
2S + 30 = 110
2S = 110 - 30
2S = 80
S = 80 / 2
S = 40

Now that we have the number of silver coins (S = 40), we can find the number of gold coins (G):

G = S + 30
G = 40 + 30
G = 70

Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

The answer: 70.

1. Raymond has 40 jewels.
2. Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels.
3. Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron.

First, let's find out how many jewels Aaron has.

Half of Raymond's jewels is:
\( \frac{40}{2}} = 20 \) jewels.

Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels, so:
\( 20 + 5 = 25 \) jewels.

Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron, so:
\( 25 - 2 = 23 \) jewels.

To find out how many total points Mike scored, we need to calculate the points he scored in the second 20 minutes and then add that to the points he scored in the first 20 minutes.

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than he scored in the first 20 minutes.

25% of 4 points is:
0.25 * 4 = 1 point

So, in the second 20 minutes, Mike scores:
4 points (from the first 20 minutes) + 1 point (25% more than the first 20 minutes)) = 5 points

Now, to find the total points scored by Mike, we add the points from the first 20 minutes to the points from the second 20 minutes.

Total points scored by Mike = Points in first 20 minutes + Points in second 20 minutes
Total points scored by Mike = 4 points + 5 points
Total points scored by Mike = 9 points

First, let's determine how many yogurts Terry eats in 30 days.

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day. So, in 30 days, he would eat:

2 yogurts/day * 30 days = 60 yogurts

Now, let's determine how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days.

The sale is for 4 yogurts for $5.00. To find out how many sets of 4 yogurts Terry will buy, we divide the total number of yogurts by 4:

60 yogurts / 4 yogurts/set = 15 sets

Now, we multiply the number of sets by the cost per set:

15 sets * $5.00/set = $75.00

Therefore, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days.

To determine how many Lego sets John still has, we need to look at the information provided about the Lego sets and the video games.

John has 13 Lego sets and sells them for $15 each. This means he earns a total of 13 Lego sets * $15 per Lego set = $195.

John then buys 8 video games for $20 each. This means he spends a total of 8 video games * $20 per video game = $160.

After buying the video games, John has $5 left. This means that the total amount of money he had before buying the video games was $160 (spent on video games) + $5 (leftover) = $165.

Since John sold all his Lego sets for a total of $195, and he had $165 in total before buying the video games, it seems there is a discrepancy in the numbers provided.

However, based on the information provided about the Lego sets, John sold all 13 Lego sets.

- Second day: 3 hours / 2 = 1.5 hours
- Third day: 1.5 hours / 2 = 0.75 hours

Now, let's add up the time he runs each week:

- Total time per week: 3 + 1.5 + 0.75 = 6 hours

Now, we can calculate his speed:

- Speed = Distance / Time
- Speed = 60 miles / 6 hours
- Speed = 10 miles per hour

[2024-12-31 15:37:25,658][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: If Dana can skip at half the speed she can run, then she can run at 3*2=<<3*2=6>>6 miles per hour.
And since she can run at a speed that is 4 times faster than she can walk, this means she can walk at 6/4=1.5 miles per hour.
If two-thirds of the time is spent walking, then she walks for 6*(2/3)=<<6*(2/3)=4>>4 hours.
If one-third of the time is spent running, then she runs for 6-4=<<6-4=2>>2 hours.
Thus, she runs for 2 hours at 6 miles per hour, or 2*6=<<2*6=12>>12 miles.
She walks for 4 hours at 1.5 miles per hour, or 4*1.5=<<4*1.5=6>>6 miles.
Thus, altogether, she travels 12+6=<<12+6=18>>18 miles.
#### 18
[2024-12-31 15:37:25,658][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
Let's break down the information given:

1. Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour.
2. Skipping speed is half as fast as running speed.
3. Running speed is four times faster than walking speed.
4. Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking.

Now, let's calculate the speeds:

- Skipping speed = 3 mph
- Running speed = 2 * Skipping speed = 2 * 3 mph = 6 mph
- Walking speed = Running speed / 4 = 6 mph / 4 = 1.5 mph

Now, let's calculate the time spent on each activity:

- Total time = 6 hours
- Time spent running = 1/3 * 6 hours = 2 hours
- Time spent walking = 2/3 * 6 hours = 4 hours

Now, let's calculate the distance traveled for each activity:

- Distance running = Running speed * Time spent running = 6 mph * 2 hours = 12 miles
- Distance walking = Walking speed * Time spent walking = 1.5 mph * 4 hours = 12 miles

Now, let's calculate the total distance traveled:

- Total distance = Distance running + Distance walking = 12 miles + 12 miles = 24 miles

#### 26
[2024-12-31 15:37:43,774][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
To find out how many pieces were taken by the guests, we need to calculate the total number of pie pieces that were originally available and then subtract the number of pieces that remained at the end of the evening.

Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies, and each pie was cut into 8 pieces.

Total number of pie pieces = Number of pies Ã— Number of pieces per pie
Total number of pie pieces = 5 pies Ã— 8 pieces per pie
Total number of pie pieces = 40 pieces

At the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining.

Number of pieces taken by guests = Total number of pie pieces - Number of pieces remaining
Number of pieces taken by guests = 40 pieces - 14 pieces
Number of pieces taken by guests = 26 pieces

If each serving of chips has 250 calories and I only have 200 calories left to eat, then I can only eat 200/250 of a serving = 4/5 of a serving
We also know that a 300g bag of chips has 5 servings, hence each serving has 300g/5 = <<300/5=60>>60 grams
If I can only eat 4/5 of a serving, then I can eat only 60g * 4/5 = 240g/5 = 48 grams
#### 48
[2024-12-31 15:37:57,832][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
To determine how many grams of chips you can eat without exceeding your daily calorie target, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the remaining calories you can consume for the day.
2. Determine the number of calories per gram of chips.
3. Calculate the maximum grams of chips you can eat without exceeding your daily calorie target.

Step 1: Remaining calories
Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories. You have already consumed 1800 calories. 

Remaining calories = Daily calorie target - Calories already consumed
Remaining calories = 2000 - 1800
Remaining calories = 200 calories

Step 2: Calories per gram of chips
A bag of chips has 250 calories per serving. If a 300g bag has 5 servings, then each serving is 300g / 5 = 60g. 

So, each serving has 250 calories, and each serving is 60g. Therefore, the number of calories per gram of chips is 250 calories / 60g = 4.17 calories per gram.

Step 3: Maximum grams of chips
To find out how many grams of chips you can eat without exceeding your daily calorie target, you divide the remaining calories by the number of calories per gram of chips.

Maximum grams of chips = Remaining calories / Calories per gram of chips
Maximum grams of chips = 200 calories / 4.17 calories per gram
Maximum grams of chips â‰ˆ 48 grams

To calculate Charlie's net profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total revenue from selling the candles.
2. Calculate the total cost of making the candles.
3. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the net profit.

Let's calculate each step:

1. Total revenue from selling the candles:
   Revenue per candle = $2.00
   Number of candles sold = 20
   Total revenue = Revenue per candle Ã— Number of candles sold
   Total revenue = $2.00 Ã— 20
   Total revenue = $40.00

2. Total cost of making the candles:
   Cost of supplies per pound of beeswax = $10.00
   Number of pounds of beeswax used = 20 candles / 10 candles per pound = 2 pounds
   Total cost of supplies = Cost of supplies per pound of beeswax Ã— Number of pounds of beeswax used
   Total cost of supplies = $10.00 Ã— 2
   Total cost of supplies = $20.00

3. Net profit:
   Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost

[2024-12-31 15:38:22,134][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: If she wrote five articles on Monday, then on Tuesday she wrote 2/5* 5 = 2 more articles.
The total number of articles she wrote on Tuesday is 5+2 = <<5+2=7>>7
On Wednesday, the number of articles was twice the number she wrote on Tuesday, so it was 2*7 = <<2*7=14>>14 articles.
Over the three days, she wrote 5+7 +14 = <<5+7+14=26>>26 articles.
If each article takes her 4 hours to research and write about, she spent 4*26 = <<4*26=104>>104 hours on all the articles.
#### 104
[2024-12-31 15:38:22,134][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
Let's break down the number of articles Meredith wrote each day:

- Monday: 5 articles
- Tuesday: 2/5 times more articles than Monday. 
  - 2/5 of Monday's articles: \( \frac{2}{5}} \times 5 = 2 \) articles
  - Tuesday's articles: 5 (Monday) + 2 (additional) = 7 articles

- Wednesday: Twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday.
  - Tuesday's articles: 7
  - Wednesday's articles: \( 2 \times 7 = 14 \) articles

Now, let's calculate the total number of hours she spent writing articles in the three days:

- Monday: \( 5 \) articles \(\times\) \( 4 \) hours/article = \( 20 \) hours
- Tuesday: \( 7 \) articles \(\times\) \( 4 \) hours/article = \( 28 \) hours
- Wednesday: \( 14 \) articles \(\times\) \( 4 \) hours/article = \( 56 \) hours

Total hours spent writing articles in the three days: \( 20 + 28 + 56 = 104 \) hours.

[2024-12-31 15:38:37,647][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: Let's let x be the number of post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased.
Then, the total number of post-it notes she had when she left the store was 80+x.
And if she used 220 Post-it notes at work and had 23 left, then 80+x=220+23
Subtracting 80 from each side of the equation, we see that x=220+23-80=<<220+23-80=163>>163 Post-it notes.
#### 163
[2024-12-31 15:38:37,647][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
Let's break down the information given:

1. Candice started with 80 Post-it notes.
2. She ended up with 23 Post-it notes remaining.
3. She used a Post-it note for each of the 220 cups of coffee.

First, let's calculate the total number of Post-it notes Candice used at work:

220 cups of coffee * 1 Post-it note per cup = 220 Post-it notes used at work.

Now, let's calculate the total number of Post-it notes Candice had after her purchase at the store:

80 Post-it notes (initial) + 23 Post-it notes (remaining) = 103 Post-it notes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of Post-it notes Candice had before her purchase at the store:

103 Post-it notes (after purchase) - 80 Post-it notes (initial) = 23 Post-it notes.

Since Candice had 23 Post-it notes remaining after her purchase, and she used 220 Post-it notes at work, we can calculate the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased:

220 Post-it notes (used at work) + 23 Post-it notes (remaining) = 243 Post-it notes.

Since Candice had 243 Post-it notes in total after her purchase, and she started with 80 Post-it notes, we can calculate the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased:

243 Post-it notes (total after purchase) - 80 Post-it notes (initial) = 163 Post-it notes.

Therefore, the package that Candice purchased contained 163 Post-it notes.

The answer: 163.

[2024-12-31 15:38:50,807][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: He bought 200 / 40 = <<200/40=5>>5 blue ties
So he bought 5 * 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 red ties
Each red tie cost $40 * .5 = $<<40*.5=20>>20 more than blue ties
So they each cost $40 + $20 = $<<40+20=60>>60
So he spent $60 * 10 = $<<60*10=600>>600 on red ties
So he spent $200 + $600 = $<<200+600=800>>800 on ties
#### 800
[2024-12-31 15:38:50,807][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Since each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

Number of blue ties = Total spent on blue ties / Cost per blue tie
Number of blue ties = $200 / $40
Number of blue ties = 5

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, he buys 2 * 5 = 10 red ties.

The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. Therefore, the cost of each red tie is:

Cost per red tie = Cost per blue tie + (50% of Cost per blue tie))
Cost per red tie = $40 + (0.5 * $40))
Cost per red tie = $40 + $20
Cost per red tie = $60

Now, let's calculate the total amount John spent on red ties:

Total spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost per red tie
Total spent on red ties = 10 * $60
Total spent on red ties = $600

Finally, let's calculate the total amount John spent on both blue and red ties:

Total spent on ties = Total spent on blue ties + Total spent on red ties
Total spent on ties = $200 + $600
Total spent on ties = $800

The answer: 800.

[2024-12-31 15:38:57,016][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: If Tracy used a piece of wire 4 feet long, since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the total length of the wire in inches was 12*4=<<12*4=48>>48 inches.
Since the wire was cut into pieces 6 inches long, Tracy obtained 48/6=<<48/6=8>>8 pieces
#### 8
[2024-12-31 15:38:57,016][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
First, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we multiply 4 feet by 12 inches per foot:

4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Now that we have the length of the wire in inches, we can determine how many 6-inch pieces Tracy can obtain from the 48-inch wire.

To find the number of 6-inch pieces, we divide the total length of the wire (in inches) by the length of each piece (in inches):

48 inches / 6 inches/piece = 8 pieces

The answer: 8.

If 3/4 of the building is occupied, then the total number of occupied units is 3/4 * 120 units = <<3/4*120=90>>90 units.
The total number of unoccupied units is 120 units - 90 units = <<120-90=30>>30 units.
#### 30
[2024-12-31 15:39:05,132][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
First, let's calculate the total number of units in the building.

There are 15 floors, and each floor contains 8 units.

Total units = Number of floors Ã— Number of units per floor
Total units = 15 floors Ã— 8 units/floor
Total units = 120 units

Now, let's calculate the number of occupied units.

3/4 of the building is occupied.

Occupied units = Total units Ã— Occupancy rate
Occupied units = 120 units Ã— 3/4
Occupied units = 120 units Ã— 0.75
Occupied units = 90 units

Now, let's calculate the number of unoccupied units.

Unoccupied units = Total units - Occupied units
Unoccupied units = 120 units - 90 units
Unoccupied units = 30 units

The answer: 30.

[2024-12-31 15:39:16,473][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
To determine how long it takes Tom to get back, we need to calculate the distance he travels and then divide that distance by his return speed.

First, let's calculate the distance Tom travels from 1 to 4 PM. Since he travels at 10 mph, we can calculate the distance as follows:

Distance = Speed Ã— Time
Distance = 10 mph Ã— 3 hours (from 1 PM to 4 PM))
Distance = 30 miles

Now that we know Tom travels 30 miles, we can calculate the time it takes him to get back at 6 mph.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 30 miles / 6 mph
Time = 5 hours

[2024-12-31 15:39:24,855][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
First, let's calculate the total weight of the comic books that Uriah wants to remove.

He has 30 comic books, and each comic book weighs 1/4 pound.

The total weight of the comic books is:
30 comic books * 1/4 pound/comic book = 7.5 pounds

Uriah wants to remove 15 pounds from his book bag. Since he has already removed 7.5 pounds with the comic books, he still needs to remove:

15 pounds - 7.5 pounds = 7.5 pounds

Now, let's calculate how many toys Uriah needs to remove to account for the remaining 7.5 pounds.

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound.

The number of toys Uriah needs to remove is:
7.5 pounds / 1/2 pound/toy = 15 toys

On Friday the mechanic charged a total of 12*40 = $<<12*40=480>>480.
Thus, on Thursday, the day with higher revenue, the mechanic had 520-480 = $<<520-480=40>>40 more revenue than on Friday.
#### 40
[2024-12-31 15:39:33,120][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
To calculate the revenue for each day, we need to multiply the number of tires repaired by the respective charge for each tire type.

For Thursday:
- Truck tires: 6 tires * $60/tire = $360
- Car tires: 4 tires * $40/tire = $160
Total revenue for Thursday = $360 + $160 = $520

For Friday:
- Car tires: 12 tires * $40/tire = $480
Total revenue for Friday = $480

Now, to find out how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, we subtract the revenue of the day with lower revenue from the revenue of the day with higher revenue.

Higher revenue day: Friday
Lower revenue day: Thursday

Difference in revenue: $520 (Thursday) - $480 (Friday) = $40

The answer: 40.

#### 83
[2024-12-31 15:40:01,406][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit, we need to calculate the remaining weight capacity of the bridge after accounting for the weight of the driver and the empty truck.

The weight limit of the bridge is 5000 pounds. The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds.

To find the remaining weight capacity of the bridge, we subtract the weight of the driver and the empty truck from the bridge's weight limit:

5000 pounds (bridge's weight limit) - 3755 pounds (weight of driver and empty truck) = 1245 pounds (remaining weight capacity of the bridge).

Now, we need to determine how many 15-pound boxes can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the remaining weight capacity of the bridge.

To do this, we divide the remaining weight capacity of the bridge by the weight of one box:

1245 pounds (remaining weight capacity of the bridge) Ã· 15 pounds (weight of one box) = 83 boxes.

Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit is 83.

Then multiply that number by the amount of her pension she gets per year: 10 years * 5% = 50%
Then multiply that percentage by the total amount of the full pension to find how much she gets: $50,000 * 50% = $<<50000*50*.01=25000>>25,000
#### 25000
[2024-12-31 15:40:42,167][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
To calculate Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to consider two parts:

1. The base annual pension of $50,000/year.
2. The additional 5% of the value of the pension per year, starting after 20 years.

Since Marcy quit after 30 years, she will not receive the additional 5% for the full 10 years. Instead, she will receive it for 10 years (from year 21 to year 30)).

Here's the calculation:

1. Base annual pension: $50,000/year
2. Additional 5% of the value of the pension per year for 10 years.

Additional pension per year = 5% of $50,000
Additional pension per year = 0.05 * $50,000
Additional pension per year = $2,500

Total additional pension over 10 years = $2,500 * 10
Total additional pension over 10 years = $25,000

Now, let's calculate the total annual pension after 30 years:

Total annual pension = Base annual pension + Total additional pension over 10 years
Total annual pension = $50,000 + $25,000

[2024-12-31 15:40:53,494][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: A year has twelve months, so a half of the year is 12/2 = <<12/2=6>>6 months,
For the first six months, the streaming service charged her a total of 6*140 = $<<6*140=840>>840
For the next half of the year, the streaming service company charged her 10/100*140 = $<<10/100*140=14>>14 less
She paid $140-$14 = $<<140-14=126>>126 each month for the remaining half of the year,
In total, she paid 126*6 = $<<126*6=756>>756 for the other half of the year for the streaming service.
The total amount of money she paid at the end of the year is $840+$756 = $<<840+756=1596>>1596

[2024-12-31 15:40:53,494][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to calculate the amount for each half of the year and then add them together.

For the first half of the year, Aleena is charged the full amount of $140 per month. There are 6 months in the first half of the year.

Amount for the first half of the year:
$140/month * 6 months = $840

For the second half of the year, Aleena is charged 10% less than the full amount. 

10% of $140 is:
$140 * 0.10 = $14

So, the reduced amount for the second half of the year is:
$140 - $14 = $126

There are also 6 months in the second half of the year.

Amount for the second half of the year:
$126/month * 6 months = $756

Now, we add the amounts for both halves of the year to find the total amount Aleena paid.

Total amount paid by Aleena:
$840 (first half) + $756 (second half) = $1596

The answer: 1596.

To determine how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to calculate the car's fuel efficiency.

Sophia has traveled 100 miles on 4 gallons of gas. To find out how many miles she can drive per gallon, we divide the miles traveled by the gallons of gas used:

100 miles / 4 gallons = 25 miles per gallon

Now that we know Sophia's car can travel 25 miles per gallon, we can calculate how many miles she can drive on a full tank.

Sophia's car's tank holds 12 gallons of gas. To find out how many miles she can drive on a full tank, we multiply the miles per gallon by the number of gallons in the tank:

25 miles per gallon * 12 gallons = 300 miles

First, let's calculate how much time Jim spends on TV and reading each day.

He watches TV for 2 hours each day.

He reads for half as long as he watches TV. So, he reads for 2 hours / 2 = 1 hour each day.

Now, let's calculate the total time he spends on TV and reading each week.

He does this 3 times a week.

So, he spends 2 hours on TV + 1 hour reading = 3 hours each day.

In a week, he spends 3 hours/day * 7 days/week = 21 hours/week.

Now, let's calculate the total time he spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks.

He spends 21 hours/week * 4 weeks = 84 hours in 4 weeks.

So each school has sent 2 teams * 5 players per team = <<2*5=10>>10 players.
They have also each sent 2 teams * 1 coach per team = <<2*1=2>>2 coaches.
In total, each school has sent 10 players + 2 coaches = <<10+2=12>>12 people.
Therefore, the schools have sent a total of 12 people per school * 4 schools = <<12*4=48>>48 people.

[2024-12-31 15:41:16,145][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
To calculate the total number of people sent by all the schools, we need to consider the number of teams and the number of people in each team.

Each school has sent:
- 1 girlsâ€™ basketball team with 5 players and 1 coach, totaling 6 people.
- 1 boysâ€™ basketball team with 5 players and 1 coach, totaling 6 people.

So, for each school, the total number of people sent is 6 (girls' team) + 6 (boys' team) = 12 people.

Since there are four schools, we multiply the number of people sent by one school by the number of schools:

12 people/school * 4 schools = 48 people.

The answer: 48.

Let's calculate the number of each gem:

1. Diamonds: There are 175 diamonds.

2. Rubies: There are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds. So, the number of rubies is:
   175 diamonds - 35 = 140 rubies

3. Emeralds: There are twice the number of emeralds than the rubies. So, the number of emeralds is:
   140 rubies * 2 = 280 emeralds

Now, let's add up the total number of gems:

Diamonds: 175
Rubies: 140
Emeralds: 280

Total gems = 175 + 140 + 280 = 685

There are 120 + 60 = <<120+60=180>>180 students in total
If there are 5 students to each teacher, then 180 students would need 180/5 = <<180/5=36>>36 teachers
#### 36
[2024-12-31 15:41:32,507][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
First, let's find out how many boys there are. Since there are twice as many boys as girls, and there are 60 girls, we can calculate the number of boys as follows:

Number of boys = 2 * Number of girls
Number of boys = 2 * 60
Number of boys = 120

Now, let's find out the total number of students at the school. We add the number of boys and girls:

Total number of students = Number of boys + Number of girls
Total number of students = 120 + 60
Total number of students = 180

Now, we know that there are 5 students to every teacher. To find out how many teachers there are, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per teacher:

Number of teachers = Total number of students / Number of students per teacher
Number of teachers = 180 / 5
Number of teachers = 36

[2024-12-31 15:41:39,836][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
To find out how much money Bailey started with, we first need to calculate the total amount of money she received as a weekly allowance.

Bailey receives $5 per week for 8 weeks. So, the total amount she receives from her weekly allowance is:

$5/week * 8 weeks = $40

Now, we know that at the end of the 8 weeks, Bailey has a total of $100.

To find out how much money Bailey started with, we subtract the total amount she received from her weekly allowance from the total amount she has at the end of the 8 weeks.

So, the calculation is:

$100 (total amount at the end) - $40 (total amount received from weekly allowance) = $60

So, each cell phone costs $150 + $3 = $<<150+3=153>>153.
The total amount to be paid for 5 cell phones is $153 x 5 = $<<153*5=765>>765.
Thus, Shiela will pay $765/3 = $<<765/3=255>>255 each month.
#### 255
[2024-12-31 15:42:11,949][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
First, let's calculate the total cost of the cell phones including the interest.

The cost of one cell phone is $150. Shiela bought five cell phones, so the total cost without interest is:

5 cell phones * $150/cell phone = $750

Now, let's calculate the interest for each cell phone. The interest rate is 2%.

Interest for one cell phone = 2% of $150
Interest for one cell phone = 0.02 * $150
Interest for one cell phone = $3

Since Shiela bought five cell phones, the total interest for all cell phones is:

Total interest = 5 cell phones * $3/cell phone
Total interest = $15

Now, let's calculate the total amount Shiela will pay for the cell phones including the interest.

Total amount Shiela will pay = Total cost without interest + Total interest
Total amount Shiela will pay = $750 + $15
Total amount Shiela will pay = $765

Now, let's calculate the monthly payment Shiela will make for 3 months.

Monthly payment = Total amount Shiela will pay / Number of months
Monthly payment = $765 / 3 months
Monthly payment = $255.33 (rounded to two decimal places)

Now, let's calculate the total sales for each type of flower:

- Marigolds: 12 pots * $3.00/pot = $36.00
- Petunias: 9 pots * $2.00/pot = $18.00
- Begonias: 17 pots * $2.00/pot = $34.00

Finally, let's add up the total sales for all the flowers:

To find the average square footage of a level in the sandcastle, we first need to determine the square footage of each level.

Given that the top level has a square footage of 16, and each level below has half the square footage of the level above it, we can calculate the square footage of each level as follows:

- Level 4 (top level): 16 square feet
- Level 3: 16 / 2 = 8 square feet
- Level 2: 8 / 2 = 4 square feet
- Level 1 (bottom level): 4 / 2 = 2 square feet

Now, to find the average square footage of a level, we add up the square footage of all levels and then divide by the number of levels.

Total square footage = 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 38 square feet

Number of levels = 4

Average square footage per level = Total square footage / Number of levels
Average square footage per level = 38 / 4 = 9.5 square feet

[2024-12-31 15:42:51,123][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
To calculate the number of bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of dog food needed for the first 180 days.
2. Calculate the total amount of dog food needed for the rest of the puppy's life.
3. Add the amounts from steps 1 and 2 to get the total amount of dog food needed for the first year.
4. Divide the total amount of dog food needed by the number of cups in one bag of dog food to get the number of bags needed.

Let's calculate:

1. For the first 180 days, the puppy needs 1 cup of dog food every day. So, the total amount of dog food needed for the first 180 days is 180 days * 1 cup/day = 180 cups.

2. For the rest of the puppy's life, the puppy needs 2 cups of dog food every day. Since we don't know the exact length of the puppy's life, we'll assume the puppy lives for an average of 10 years. So, the total amount of dog food needed for the rest of the puppy's life is 10 years * 365 days/year * 2 cups/day = 136,700 cups.

3. Adding the amounts from steps 1 and 2, we get the total amount of dog food needed for the first year is 180 cups + 136,700 cups = 136,880 cups.

4. Finally, to find out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we divide the total amount of dog food needed by the number of cups in one bag of dog food: 136,880 cups / 110 cups/bag = 1,241.82 bags.

Since we can't have a fraction of a bag, we'll round up to the nearest whole bag. Therefore, Cecilia will use 1,242 bags of dog food in the first year.

The answer: 1242.

To determine how much money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price, we need to calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at both prices and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at the price of 3 flowers for $2.50.

To get 18 flowers, Vincent would need to buy 6 sets of 3 flowers.

Cost for 18 flowers at 3 flowers for $2.50:
6 sets * $2.50 per set = $15.00

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at the price of 2 flowers for $1.

To get 18 flowers, Vincent would need to buy 9 sets of 2 flowers.

Cost for 18 flowers at 2 flowers for $1:
9 sets * $1 per set = $9.00

Now, let's find the difference in cost between buying 18 flowers at the better price and buying them at the other price.

Difference in cost:
$15.00 (cost at better price) - $9.00 (cost at other price) = $6.00

To calculate the discount amount, we multiply the original cost by the discount percentage:

$100 (original cost) x 0.30 (30% discount) = $30 (discount amount)

Now, we subtract the discount amount from the original cost to find the final grooming cost:

$100 (original cost) - $30 (discount amount) = $70

[2024-12-31 15:43:21,907][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: Each of the girls got 24 x 1/6 = <<24*1/6=4>>4 liters of water.
So the two girls got a total of 4 x 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 liters.
Thus, a total of 8 + 6 = <<8+6=14>>14 liters of water were gotten by the two girls and the boy.
Therefore, 24 - 14 = <<24-14=10>>10 liters of water were left.
#### 10
[2024-12-31 15:43:21,907][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
First, let's find out how much water each girl got. Since they each got 1/6 of the 24 liters of water, we calculate:

1/6 * 24 liters = 4 liters

So, each girl got 4 liters of water.

Now, let's find out how much water was left after the girls got their share:

24 liters (total) - 4 liters (girl 1) - 4 liters (girl 2) = 12 liters

After the girls got their share, there were 12 liters of water left.

Now, let's account for the boy who got 6 liters of water:

12 liters (left after girls) - 6 liters (boy) = 6 liters

The answer: 6.

Charlie has 54 âˆ’ 37 = 17 stickers left.
#### 17
[2024-12-31 15:43:31,054][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
To find out how many stickers Charlie has left, we need to add up all the stickers he has received and then subtract the stickers he has given away and used.

Here's the breakdown:

- Stickers Charlie started with: 10
- Stickers Charlie bought: 21
- Stickers Charlie received for his birthday: 23
- Stickers Charlie gave to his sister: -9
- Stickers Charlie used to decorate a greeting card: -28

Now, let's add up all the stickers Charlie has received and then subtract the stickers he has given away and used.

Total stickers Charlie has received:
10 (initial) + 21 (bought) + 23 (birthday) = 77 stickers

Now, subtract the stickers Charlie has given away and used:

Stickers Charlie has left:
77 (total received) - 9 (given to sister) - 28 (used for greeting card)) = 40 stickers

Their combined weights are 125+498 = <<125+498=623>>623 pounds.
#### 623
[2024-12-31 15:43:37,275][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
First, let's find out how much Alex weighs.

Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs.

Grace weighs 125 pounds.

So, 4 times what Grace weighs is:
4 * 125 = 500 pounds.

Now, we subtract 2 pounds from this amount to find Alex's weight:
500 - 2 = 498 pounds.

Now, let's find their combined weights.

Grace weighs 125 pounds.
Alex weighs 498 pounds.

Combined weight = Grace's weight + Alex's weight
Combined weight = 125 + 498
Combined weight = 623 pounds.

The answer: 623.

[2024-12-31 15:43:54,996][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: Let L be the number of losses.
The number of wins is L + <<+8=8>>8.
The team played (L+8) + L = 2L + 8 = 22 games.
So, 2L = 22 - 8 = 14
So L = 14/2 = <<14/2=7>>7 losses.
Therefore, the team won 22 â€“ 7 = <<22-7=15>>15 games.
#### 15
[2024-12-31 15:43:54,997][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
Let's denote the number of games the team lost as L. According to the information given, the team won 8 more games than they lost. This can be expressed as:

W = L + 8

We also know that the total number of games played is 22. This means that the sum of the games won and the games lost should equal 22:

W + L = 22

Now we have a system of two equations with two variables:

1) W = L + 8
2) W + L = 22

We can solve this system by substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution. From equation 1, we can express W in terms of L:

W = L + 8

Now we substitute W in equation 2 with the expression we found for W:

(L + 8) + L = 22

Now we combine like terms:

2L + 8 = 22

Next, we subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:

2L = 22 - 8
2L = 14

Now we divide both sides by 2 to solve for L:

L = 14 / 2
L = 7

Now that we know the team lost 7 games, we can find out how many games they won by using the equation W = L + 8:

W = 7 + 8
W = 15

So, the team won 15 games.

The answer: 15.

He goes on 4 vacations a year, so he has been on 4 * 11 = <<4*11=44>>44 vacations.
Gene has 1 shirt from each vacation, so he has 44 * 1 = <<44*1=44>>44 quilt blocks in all.
#### 44
[2024-12-31 15:44:01,054][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
To calculate the total number of quilt blocks Gene has, we need to consider the number of vacations he has been on and the number of vacations he goes on each year.

Gene has been vacationing since he was 23 years old. He is now 34. This means he has been vacationing for 34 - 23 = 11 years.

Since Gene goes on four vacations a year, the total number of vacations he has been on is 11 years * 4 vacations/year = 44 vacations.

Since each shirt from a vacation is its own quilt block, Gene has 44 quilt blocks in total.

The answer: 44.

In all, Gregâ€™s alarm rang 4 + 12 + 6 = <<4+12+6=22>>22 times.
#### 22

Let's break down the information given:

1. The alarm rings three times a day.
2. The first time it went off today, it rang four times.
3. The second time it went off, it rang for three times as long as the first time.
4. The third time, it rang for half as long as the second time.

Now, let's calculate the number of times the alarm rang:

1. The first time, it rang four times.
2. The second time, it rang for three times as long as the first time. Since the first time it rang four times, the second time it rang 4 * 3 = 12 times.
3. The third time, it rang for half as long as the second time. Since the second time it rang 12 times, the third time it rang 12 / 2 = 6 times.

Now, let's add up the total number of times the alarm rang:

First time: 4 times
Second time: 12 times
Third time: 6 times

Total: 4 + 12 + 6 = 22 times

#### 9360
[2024-12-31 15:44:29,953][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
To calculate Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate Sylvie's current annual salary.
2. Calculate the 10% increase on Sylvie's current annual salary.
3. Add the 10% increase to Sylvie's current annual salary to get her new annual salary.
4. Repeat steps 2-3 for each of the three following years.

Step 1: Calculate Sylvie's current annual salary.
Sylvie's monthly salary = $600
Sylvie's current annual salary = $600 * 12 = $7,200

Step 2: Calculate the 10% increase on Sylvie's current annual salary.
10% of Sylvie's current annual salary = 0.10 * $7,200 = $720

Step 3: Add the 10% increase to Sylvie's current annual salary to get her new annual salary.
Sylvie's new annual salary = $7,200 + $720 = $7,920

Step 4: Repeat steps 2-3 for each of the three following years.

Year 1:
10% increase = 0.10 * $7,920 = $792
New annual salary = $7,920 + $792 = $8,712

Year 2:
10% increase = 0.10 * $8,712 = $871.20
New annual salary = $8,712 + $871.20 = $9,583.20

Year 3:
10% increase = 0.10 * $9,583.20 = $958.332
New annual salary = $9,583.20 + $958.332 = $10,541.532

Substituting the second equation into the first, we get 10h + h = 88,000
Combining like terms, we get 11h = 88,000
Dividing both sides by 11, we get h = 8,000
#### 8000
[2024-12-31 15:44:36,820][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
Let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as H. According to the problem, Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, so Marilyn sold 10H copies.

The total number of copies sold by both Harald and Marilyn is 88,000. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

H + 10H = 88,000

Combining like terms, we get:

11H = 88,000

To find H, we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

H = 88,000 / 11
H = 8,000

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies.

The answer: 8,000.

First, we need to calculate how many guests will actually show up. Since 1/4 of attendees don't show up, we can calculate the number of attendees who will show up:

Number of attendees who will show up = Total number of invited guests Ã— (1 - 1/4))

Number of attendees who will show up = 16 Ã— (1 - 1/4))
Number of attendees who will show up = 16 Ã— (1 - 0.25))
Number of attendees who will show up = 16 Ã— (0.75))
Number of attendees who will show up = 16 Ã— 0.75
Number of attendees who will show up = 12

Now that we know 12 guests will show up, we can calculate the number of gift bags needed:

Number of gift bags needed = Number of attendees who will show up Ã— Number of gift bags per invited guest

Number of gift bags needed = 12 Ã— 0.75
Number of gift bags needed = 9

Now that we know Christina needs 9 gift bags, we can calculate the total cost:

Total cost = Number of gift bags needed Ã— Cost per gift bag

Total cost = 9 Ã— $2
Total cost = $18

10% of 40 seconds is 40*0.1=<<40*0.1=4>>4 seconds.
The improved diet reduced Gerald's race time to 40-4=<<40-4=36>>36 seconds.
#### 36
[2024-12-31 15:45:24,249][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
Let's denote Gerald's original time to run the 400-meter hurdles as \( G \) seconds.

According to the information given, Lee runs 2 seconds faster than Gerald. Therefore, we can write the following equation:

\[ L = G - 2 \]

We know that Lee's time is 38 seconds, so we can substitute \( L \) with 38 in the equation:

\[ 38 = G - 2 \]

Now, let's solve for \( G \):

\[ G = 38 + 2 \]
\[ G = 40 \]

So, Gerald's original time was 40 seconds.

Now, Gerald improved his speed by 10%. To find out how much time this improvement saves Gerald, we calculate 10% of Gerald's original time:

\[ \text{Improvement time} } = 0.10 \times 40 \]
\[ \text{Improvement time} } = 4 \]

So, Gerald's improved diet saves him 4 seconds.

Now, let's find out Gerald's new time after his diet improvement:

\[ \text{Gerald's new time} } = G - \text{Improvement time} } \]
\[ \text{Gerald's new time} } = 40 - 4 \]
\[ \text{Gerald's new time} } = 36 \]

So, with his improved diet, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds.

Harry slept 9 hours, so:

James's sleep hours = (2/3) * Harry's sleep hours
James's sleep hours = (2/3) * 9
James's sleep hours = (2/3) * 27
James's sleep hours = 18

Now, to find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we subtract James's sleep hours from Harry's sleep hours.

Difference in sleep hours = Harry's sleep hours - James's sleep hours
Difference in sleep hours = 9 - 18
Difference in sleep hours = -9

Since the result is negative, it means that James actually slept more hours than Harry. Therefore, Harry did not sleep more hours than James.

[2024-12-31 15:45:59,191][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: Tomatoes lose half their volume when made into sauce, so Freda started with 32 * 2 = <<32*2=64>>64 ounces of tomatoes.
At 16 ounces per can, she used 64 / 16 = <<64/16=4>>4 cans of tomatoes.
At 3 tomatoes a can, Freda used 3 * 4 = <<3*4=12>>12 tomatoes.

To determine how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the volume of tomatoes used to make the sauce.
2. Calculate the number of tomatoes used based on the information given.

Step 1: The sauce made is 32 ounces. Since the tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked, the original volume of the tomatoes was twice the volume of the sauce. Therefore, the original volume of the tomatoes was 32 ounces * 2 = 64 ounces.

Step 2: Each 16-ounce can of tomatoes contains three tomatoes. To find out how many cans Freda used, we divide the total volume of tomatoes used (64 ounces) by the volume of one can (16 ounces).

64 ounces / 16 ounces per can = 4 cans

Now, since each can contains three tomatoes, we multiply the number of cans by the number of tomatoes per can.

4 cans * 3 tomatoes per can = 12 tomatoes

The answer: 12.

[2024-12-31 15:46:14,594][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: The cars that exited do not need to be included so there were 30 original cars â€“ 5 cars that exited = <<30-5=25>>25 cars that drove through the traffic jam.
Most of the cars exited in the final 15 minutes so in the first 15 minutes, there must have been 25 total cars â€“ 20 cars that drove through in the final 15 minutes = 5 cars that drove through the traffic jam.
#### 5
[2024-12-31 15:46:14,594][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
To determine how many cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes, we need to look at the information provided.

We know that:
- 20 cars drive through in the remaining 15 minutes.
- 5 cars take an exit and do not drive through the traffic jam.

We are not given the exact number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes. However, we can calculate the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam and then subtract the cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes and the cars that took an exit.

Total cars that drove through the traffic jam = 30 (original number of cars) - 5 (cars that took an exit))

Total cars that drove through the traffic jam = 25

Now, subtract the cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes and the cars that took an exit.

Total cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes = Total cars that drove through the traffic jam - 20 (cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes)) - 5 (cars that took an exit))

Total cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes = 25 - 20 - 5

Total cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes = 0

This result seems incorrect because it implies that no cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes. This is likely due to an error in the calculation or in the interpretation of the information provided.

Given the information provided, it is not possible to accurately determine the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.

The answer: 0.
