[2024-12-31 13:59:24,401][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: Janet sells 16 - 3 - 4 = <<16-3-4=9>>9 duck eggs a day.
She makes 9 * 2 = $<<9*2=18>>18 every day at the farmer’s market.
#### 18
[2024-12-31 13:59:24,401][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of eggs left for sale at the farmers' market after Janet uses some for breakfast and muffins for her friends.

Here's the breakdown:

1. Total eggs laid per day: 16
2. Eggs eaten for breakfast: 3
3. Eggs used for muffins: 4

Now, let's calculate the number of eggs left for sale:

Total eggs laid - Eggs eaten for breakfast - Eggs used for muffins
= 16 - 3 - 4
= 16 - 7
= 9

Janet has 9 eggs left for sale at the farmers' market.

Now, let's calculate how much she makes from selling these eggs:

Number of eggs left for sale: 9
Price per egg at the farmers' market: $2

Total earnings from selling eggs:
= Number of eggs left for sale × Price per egg
= 9 × $2
= $18

Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market by selling the remaining eggs.

The answer: 18.

[2024-12-31 13:59:30,092][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of bolts required for the robe.

1. Blue fiber: The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber.

2. White fiber: The robe takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber. Since the robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber, it takes half of that for white fiber, which is 1 bolt of white fiber.

Now, let's add up the total number of bolts required:

Blue fiber: 2 bolts
White fiber: 1 bolt

Total bolts required: 2 + 1 = 3 bolts

The answer: 3.

[2024-12-31 13:59:41,756][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: The cost of the house and repairs came out to 80,000+50,000=$<<80000+50000=130000>>130,000
He increased the value of the house by 80,000*1.5=<<80000*1.5=120000>>120,000
So the new value of the house is 120,000+80,000=$<<120000+80000=200000>>200,000
So he made a profit of 200,000-130,000=$<<200000-130000=70000>>70,000
#### 70000
[2024-12-31 13:59:41,756][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
To calculate the profit Josh made, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the increased value of the house after repairs.
2. Calculate the original value of the house before repairs.
3. Calculate the total cost of the house including the purchase price and the repair costs.
4. Calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the increased value of the house.

Let's calculate each step:

1. Increased value of the house after repairs:
   Original value = $80,000
   Increase = 150% of the original value
   Increase = 1.5 * $80,000
   Increase = $120,000

2. The original value of the house before repairs is already given as $80,000.

3. Total cost of the house including the purchase price and the repair costs:
   Purchase price = $80,000
   Repair costs = $50,000
   Total cost = Purchase price + Repair costs
   Total cost = $80,000 + $50,000
   Total cost = $130,000

4. Calculate the profit:
   Profit = Increased value - Total cost
   Profit = $120,000 - $130,000
   Profit = -$10,000

The answer: -10000.

[2024-12-31 14:00:12,807][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: The discount price of one glass is 60/100 * 5 = $<<60/100*5=3>>3.
If every second glass is cheaper, that means Kylar is going to buy 16 / 2 = <<16/2=8>>8 cheaper glasses.
So for the cheaper glasses, Kylar is going to pay 8 * 3 = $<<8*3=24>>24.
And for the regular-priced glasses, Kylar will pay 8 * 5 = $<<8*5=40>>40.
So in total Kylar needs to pay 24 + 40 = $<<24+40=64>>64 for the glasses he wants to buy.
#### 64
[2024-12-31 14:00:12,807][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of the glasses for Kylar.

Let's break down the cost:

1. The first glass costs $5.
2. Every second glass costs 60% of the price, which is 60% of $5.

Let's calculate the cost for 16 glasses:

1. The first glass costs $5.
2. The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is $5 * 0.60 = $3.
3. The third glass costs $5.
4. The fourth glass costs 60% of $5, which is $3.

This pattern continues for the 16 glasses. Every second glass is 60% of the price of the first glass.

Let's calculate the total cost:

1. The cost for the first glass is $5.
2. The cost for the second glass is $3.
3. The cost for the third glass is $5.
4. The cost for the fourth glass is $3.

This pattern repeats for 16 glasses. So, we have 8 pairs of glasses (since 16 glasses divided by 2 glasses per pair equals 8 pairs).

Now, let's calculate the total cost for 16 glasses:

- The cost for the first glass in each pair is $5. Since there are 8 pairs, the total cost for the first glass in each pair is $5 * 8 = $40.
- The cost for the second glass in each pair is $3. Since there are 8 pairs, the total cost for the second glass in each pair is $3 * 8 = $24.

Now, let's add the costs together to find the total cost for 16 glasses:

Total cost = Cost for first glass in each pair + Cost for second glass in each pair
Total cost = $40 + $24
Total cost = $64

The answer: 64.

Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, which is 2 * 80 sheep = <<2*80=160>>160 sheep
Together, the three has 20 sheep + 160 sheep + 80 sheep = <<20+160+80=260>>260 sheep
#### 260
[2024-12-31 14:00:20,462][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
Let's break down the information given:

1. Seattle has 20 sheep.
2. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
3. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.

Now, let's calculate the number of sheep each city has:

1. Seattle has 20 sheep.
2. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.
3. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, let's add up the number of sheep in all three cities:

Seattle: 20 sheep
Charleston: 80 sheep
Toulouse: 160 sheep

Total sheep = 20 + 80 + 160 = 360 sheep

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for Carla to download the 200 GB file, considering the restart and the time it takes to install updates.

1. Calculate the time it takes to download the file without any interruptions:
   Time to download = Total file size / Download speed
   Time to download = 200 GB / 2 GB/minute
   Time to download = 100 minutes

2. Calculate the time it takes for the Windows update installation:
   Time for updates = 20 minutes

3. Calculate the time it takes for Carla to restart the download:
   Time to restart download = 0 minutes (since it's a hypothetical scenario)

4. Calculate the total time it takes for Carla to download the file:
   Total time = Time to download + Time for updates + Time to restart download
   Total time = 100 minutes + 20 minutes + 0 minutes
   Total time = 120 minutes

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance John travels in each segment of his journey and then subtract the total distance he has traveled from his starting point.

1. First leg of the journey:
   - Time: 3 hours
   - Speed: 60 mph
   - Distance: Time × Speed = 3 hours × 60 mph = 180 miles

2. Second leg of the journey (return trip):
   - Time: 4 hours
   - Time spent in traffic: 2 hours
   - Time spent driving at 30 mph: 0.5 hours
   - Time spent driving at 80 mph: 4 hours - 2 hours (traffic) - 0.5 hours (30 mph) - 0.5 hours (30 mph) = 0.5 hours

3. Calculate the distance traveled in each segment:
   - Distance in traffic: 2 hours × 60 mph = 120 miles
   - Distance at 30 mph: 0.5 hours × 30 mph = 7.5 miles
   - Distance at 80 mph: 0.5 hours × 80 mph = 40 miles

4. Calculate the total distance traveled:
   - Total distance = Distance in traffic + Distance at 30 mph + Distance at 80 mph
   - Total distance = 120 miles + 7.5 miles + 40 miles = 187.5 miles

5. Calculate the distance from home at the end of the 4 hours:
   - Distance from home = Total distance traveled - Distance traveled on the first leg
   - Distance from home = 187.5 miles - 180 miles = 7.5 miles

The answer: 7.5.

[2024-12-31 14:00:54,624][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: Eliza is entitled to 45 -40 = <<45-40=5>>5 hours overtime pay.
Her hourly rate for the overtime pay is $10 x 1.2 = $<<10*1.2=12>>12.
So, Eliza will receive $12 x 5 =$<<12*5=60>>60 for overtime pay.
Her regular weekly earning is $10 x 40 = $<<10*40=400>>400.
Thus, Eliza will receive a total of $400 + $60 = $<<400+60=460>>460 for this week's work.
#### 460
[2024-12-31 14:00:54,624][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to consider both her regular pay and her overtime pay.

1. Regular Pay:
Eliza's regular hourly rate is $10. She worked for 40 hours at this rate.

Regular pay for 40 hours = 40 hours * $10/hour = $400

2. Overtime Pay:
Eliza's overtime pay rate is 1.2 times her regular hourly rate.

Overtime pay rate = 1.2 * $10/hour = $12/hour

Eliza worked 5 hours of overtime (45 total hours - 40 regular hours).

Overtime pay for 5 hours = 5 hours * $12/hour = $60

3. Total Earnings:
To find Eliza's total earnings for the week, we add her regular pay and her overtime pay.

Total earnings = Regular pay + Overtime pay
Total earnings = $400 + $60
Total earnings = $460

The answer: 460.

To determine how many years it will take before Carlos starts earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the costs and earnings over time.

Let's break down the costs and earnings:

**Costs:**
1. Initial planting cost: $90
2. Annual watering and feeding cost: $3

**Earnings:**
1. Annual lemon production: 7 lemons
2. Selling price per lemon: $1.5

Now, let's calculate the net earnings per year:

Earnings per year = Lemon production per year * Selling price per lemon
Earnings per year = 7 lemons * $1.5 per lemon
Earnings per year = $10.5

Now, let's calculate the net cost per year:

Net cost per year = Annual watering and feeding cost
Net cost per year = $3

Now, let's calculate the net earnings per year after subtracting the net cost:

Net earnings per year = Earnings per year - Net cost per year
Net earnings per year = $10.5 - $3
Net earnings per year = $7.5

Now, let's calculate how many years it will take before Carlos starts earning money:

Years to start earning = Initial planting cost / Net earnings per year
Years to start earning = $90 / $7.5
Years to start earning = 12 years

The answer: 12.

Then add two to figure out how many vacuum cleaners she had before visiting the red house: 10 + 2 = <<10+2=12>>12
Now we know that 2/3 * x = 12, where x is the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with. We can find x by dividing each side of the equation by 2/3, which produces x = 18
#### 18
[2024-12-31 14:01:53,072][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. Let's call the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with "x."

2. A third of her vacuum cleaners is x/3.

3. After selling a third at the green house, she has x - x/3 = 2x/3 vacuum cleaners left.

4. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house. So, she now has 2x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners left.

5. She then sold half of what was left at the orange house. So, she sold (1/2) * (2x/3 - 2)) vacuum cleaners at the orange house.

6. After selling at the orange house, she has (2x/3 - 2) - (1/2) * (2x/3 - 2))) vacuum cleaners left.

7. According to the problem, Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So, we can set up the following equation:

(2x/3 - 2) - (1/2) * (2x/3 - 2))) = 5

Now, let's solve for x:

(2x/3 - 2) - (1/2) * (2x/3 - 2))) = 5

First, let's simplify the equation by combining like terms:

(2x/3 - 2) - (1/2) * (2x/3 - 2))) = 5

Let's simplify the terms inside the parentheses:

(2x/3 - 2) - (1/2) * (2x/3 - 2))) = 5

Now, let's distribute the (1/2)) term:

(2x/3 - 2) - (1/2) * (2x/3 - 2))) = 5

Now, let's combine like terms:

(2x/3 - 2) - (1/2) * (2x/3 - 2))) = 5

Now, let's simplify the equation further:

(2x/3 - 2) - (1/2) * (2x/3 - 2))) = 5

Now, let's multiply through by 2 to clear the fractions:

2 * (2x/3 - 2) - (1/2) * (2x/3 - 2)))) = 2 * 5

This simplifies to:

4x/3 - 4 - x/3 + 2 = 10

Now, let's combine like terms:

4x/3 - x/3 - 4 + 2 = 10

This simplifies to:

3x/3 - 2 = 10

This simplifies further to:

x - 2 = 10

Now, let's solve for x:

x - 2 = 10

x = 10 + 2

x = 12

So, Melanie started with 12 vacuum cleaners.

The answer: 12.

   20% of 20 students = 0.20 * 20 = 4 students

2. Calculate the number of students remaining after the contemporary dance enrollment:
   20 students - 4 students = 16 students

3. Calculate the number of students enrolled in jazz dance:
   25% of the remaining 16 students = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students

4. Calculate the number of students remaining after the jazz dance enrollment:
   16 students - 4 students = 12 students

5. The remaining 12 students are enrolled in hip-hop dance.

6. Calculate the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance:
   (Number of students in hip-hop dance / Total number of students) * 100
   (12 / 20) * 100 = 0.60 * 100 = 60%

The answer: 60.

[2024-12-31 14:02:12,361][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: If he purchases jewelry, he will make a profit of 2.5% which is $5000*(2.5/100) = $<<5000*(2.5/100)=125>>125
If he purchases electronic gadgets, he will make a profit of 1.2% which is $8000*(1.2/100) = $<<8000*(1.2/100)=96>>96
If he wants to maximize profit, since $125 > $96, he will choose to purchase jewelry, thereby making a profit of $<<125=125>>125
#### 125
[2024-12-31 14:02:12,361][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
To calculate the profit from each purchase plan, we need to apply the percentage increase to the initial value of each purchase plan.

For the jewelry worth $5,000 with a 2.5% increase:

Profit from jewelry = $5,000 * 2.5%
Profit from jewelry = $5,000 * 0.025
Profit from jewelry = $5,000 * 0.00025
Profit from jewelry = $12.50

For the electronic gadgets worth $8,000 with a 1.2% increase:

Profit from electronic gadgets = $8,000 * 1.2%
Profit from electronic gadgets = $8,000 * 0.012
Profit from electronic gadgets = $8,000 * 0.00012
Profit from electronic gadgets = $9.60

Now, let's compare the profits:

Profit from jewelry = $12.50
Profit from electronic gadgets = $9.60

The merchant would maximize profit by choosing the jewelry worth $5,000.

The answer: 12.50.

[2024-12-31 14:02:20,656][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: On the first day, the trains covered 2 trains * 80 miles/train = <<2*80=160>>160 miles together.
They also covered 150 miles/train * 2 trains = <<150*2=300>>300 miles together on the second day.
The combined distance the two trains covered in the two days is 300 miles + 160 miles = <<300+160=460>>460 miles
The average distance for the two days is 460 miles / 2 trains = <<460/2=230>>230 miles/train
#### 230
[2024-12-31 14:02:20,656][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
To find the total distance covered by each train in the two days, we need to add the distances covered on each day.

On the first day, both trains travel westward for 80 miles each. So, the total distance covered by each train on the first day is:

80 miles (Train 1) + 80 miles (Train 2) = 160 miles

On the second day, both trains travel northward, covering 150 miles each. So, the total distance covered by each train on the second day is:

150 miles (Train 1) + 150 miles (Train 2) = 300 miles

Now, we add the distances covered on each day to find the total distance covered by each train in the two days:

160 miles (Total on Day 1) + 300 miles (Total on Day 2) = 460 miles

The answer: 460.

Then find the total amount Jill makes per week coaching: $30/hour * 15 hours/week = $<<30*15=450>>450/week
Then add those two amounts to find the total amount Jill makes per week: $700/week + $450/week = $<<700+450=1150>>1150/week
Then multiply that number by the number of weeks Jill works in a year to find her annual salary: $1150/week * 50 weeks/year = $<<1150*50=57500>>57,500
#### 57500
[2024-12-31 14:02:32,877][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from teaching and cheerleading coaching separately, and then add them together.

1. Earnings from teaching:
   - Hours per week: 35
   - Weeks per year: 50
   - Hourly rate: $20

   Total earnings from teaching per year:
   \( 35 \text{ hours/week} } \times 50 \text{ weeks/year} } \times 20 \text{ dollars/hour} } = 350,000 \text{ dollars} \)

2. Earnings from cheerleading coaching:
   - Hours per week: 15
   - Weeks per year: 50
   - Hourly rate: $30

   Total earnings from cheerleading coaching per year:
   \( 15 \text{ hours/week} } \times 50 \text{ weeks/year} } \times 30 \text{ dollars/hour} } = 225,000 \text{ dollars} \)

Now, we add the earnings from teaching and cheerleading coaching to get her annual salary.

Total annual salary:
\( 350,000 \text{ dollars} } + 225,000 \text{ dollars} } = 575,000 \text{ dollars} } \)

The answer: 575,000.

There are 12 eggs in 1 dozen and she'll eat 84 eggs so that's 84/12 = <<84/12=7>>7 dozen eggs
#### 7
[2024-12-31 14:02:44,464][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of eggs Claire uses in one omelet.
2. Calculate the number of omelets Claire makes in one week.
3. Determine the total number of omelets Claire makes in 4 weeks.
4. Calculate the total number of eggs Claire uses in 4 weeks.
5. Convert the total number of eggs into dozens.

Step 1: Claire uses 3 eggs for each omelet.

Step 2: Since there are 7 days in a week, and Claire makes 1 omelet per day, she makes 7 omelets in one week.

Step 3: In 4 weeks, Claire will make 4 weeks * 7 omelets/week = 28 omelets.

Step 4: Since each omelet requires 3 eggs, the total number of eggs used in 4 weeks is 28 omelets * 3 eggs/omelet = 84 eggs.

Step 5: To convert the total number of eggs into dozens, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 (since there are 12 eggs in a dozen).

84 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 7 dozens.

The answer: 7.

[2024-12-31 14:03:00,331][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: First figure out how many hours it takes to hike a 12-mile trail at 4 mph by dividing the distance by the speed: 12 miles / 4 mph = <<12/4=3>>3 hours
Next subtract the time Marissa already spent walking to find out how much time she has left: 3 hours - 1 hour - 1 hour = <<3-1-1=1>>1 hour
Now figure out how much distance she has left by subtracting the distance she already traveled from the total distance: 12 miles - 4 miles - 2 miles = <<12-4-2=6>>6 miles
Now divide the remaining distance by the remaining time to find out how fast in miles per hour Marissa has to travel: 6 miles / 1 hour = <<6/1=6>>6 mph
#### 6
[2024-12-31 14:03:00,331][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time Marissa has to walk the remaining distance and then determine the speed she needs to maintain.

First, let's calculate the time Marissa has already spent walking:

- She walked the first 4 miles in 1 hour.
- She walked the next 2 miles in another 1 hour.

So far, Marissa has walked 6 miles in 2 hours.

Now, let's calculate the remaining distance and the time Marissa has left to maintain her average speed of 4 miles per hour.

The total distance of the trail is 12 miles. Marissa has already walked 6 miles, so the remaining distance is:

12 miles (total distance) - 6 miles (distance already walked) = 6 miles (remaining distance)

Marissa wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour. To maintain this average speed over the entire 12-mile trail, Marissa has a total of:

12 miles (total distance) / 4 miles per hour (desired average speed) = 3 hours (total time to maintain average speed)

Since Marissa has already spent 2 hours walking, she has:

3 hours (total time to maintain average speed) - 2 hours (time already spent walking) = 1 hour (time remaining to walk the remaining distance)

Now, we can calculate the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining 6 miles in 1 hour:

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 6 miles / 1 hour
Speed = 6 miles per hour

Therefore, Marissa needs to walk at a speed of 6 miles per hour to maintain her average speed at 4 miles per hour over the entire 12-mile trail.

The answer: 6.

[2024-12-31 14:03:10,297][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: There are 15 x 3/5 = <<15*3/5=9>>9 liters of water from the 15 liters pineapple drink.
After 1 liter of orange drink was spilled, there were 10 - 1 = <<10-1=9>>9 liters of orange drink left.
Out of the 9 liters, 9 x 2/3 = <<9*2/3=6>>6 liters are water.
Thus, there are a total of 9 + 6 = <<9+6=15>>15 liters of water out of the 24 liters.
#### 15
[2024-12-31 14:03:10,297][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water in each drink before and after the spill, and then add these amounts together.

**Orange Drink:**
- Total volume: 10 liters
- Water content: 2/3 of the total volume
- Water content in liters: (2/3) * 10 = 6.67 liters

**Pineapple Drink:**
- Total volume: 15 liters
- Water content: 3/5 of the total volume
- Water content in liters: (3/5) * 15 = 9 liters

**After Spill:**
- Remaining orange drink: 10 liters - 1 liter = 9 liters
- Remaining water in orange drink: 6.67 liters - 1 liter = 5.67 liters

**Total Water Content:**
- Water from orange drink: 5.67 liters
- Water from pineapple drink: 9 liters

Total water content = 5.67 liters + 9 liters = 14.67 liters

The answer: 14.67.

[2024-12-31 14:06:23,804][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: Let X be the original price of the book. The discounted price is X - X*25% = $19.50.
Combining like terms, we get .75X = $19.50
Dividing both sides by .75, we get X = $26.
#### 26
[2024-12-31 14:06:23,804][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
To find the original price of the book, we need to calculate the price before the 25% discount was applied.

Let's denote the original price as \( P \).

Kyle bought the book for $19.50, which is after a 25% discount. This means that Kyle paid 75% of the original price.

So, we can set up the equation:

\( 0.75P = 19.50 \)

[2024-12-31 14:06:35,927][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: Five packs of milk cost $3 x 5 = $<<3*5=15>>15.
Four apples cost $1.50 x 4 = $<<1.5*4=6>>6.
The total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples is $12 + $15 + $6 = $<<12+15+6=33>>33.
Thus, the boxes of pizza cost $50 - $33 = $<<50-33=17>>17.
Therefore, Marie ordered $17/$8.50 = <<17/8.5=2>>2 boxes of pizza.
#### 2
[2024-12-31 14:06:35,927][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the items Marie ordered, excluding the pizza, and then subtract that amount from the total amount Marie paid.

Let's calculate the cost of each item:

1. Chicken meal: $12
2. Milk packs: 5 packs * $3 each = $15
3. Apples: 4 apples * $1.50 each = $6

Now, let's add up the costs of these items:

Total cost of chicken meal, milk packs, and apples = $12 + $15 + $6 = $33

Now, we know that Marie paid a total of $50. To find out how much Marie spent on pizza, we subtract the total cost of the other items from the total amount Marie paid:

Total amount paid by Marie - Total cost of other items = Amount spent on pizza
$50 - $33 = $17

Now, we know that each box of pizza costs $8.50. To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we divide the amount spent on pizza by the cost of each box of pizza:

Amount spent on pizza / Cost of each box of pizza = Number of boxes of pizza ordered
$17 / $8.50 = 2

Therefore, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza.

The answer: 2.

#### 243
[2024-12-31 14:06:49,028][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
To find out how much Mishka spent on all the clothing items, we need to calculate the total cost for each type of clothing and then sum these totals.

1. Calculate the total cost for the shorts:
   Total cost for shorts = Number of pairs of shorts × Cost per pair of shorts
   Total cost for shorts = 3 × $16.50
   Total cost for shorts = 3 × $16.50 = $49.50

2. Calculate the total cost for the pants:
   Total cost for pants = Number of pairs of pants × Cost per pair of pants
   Total cost for pants = 3 × $22.50
   Total cost for pants = 3 × $22.50 = $67.50

3. Calculate the total cost for the shoes:
   Total cost for shoes = Number of pairs of shoes × Cost per pair of shoes
   Total cost for shoes = 3 × $42
   Total cost for shoes = 3 × $42 = $126

Now, we add up the total costs for each type of clothing:

Total cost for all clothing items = Total cost for shorts + Total cost for pants + Total cost for shoes
Total cost for all clothing items = $49.50 + $67.50 + $126
Total cost for all clothing items = $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $343

The answer: 343.

#### 25
[2024-12-31 14:07:03,764][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance Henry traveled between his first and second stops.

1. Henry made his first stop after 20 miles.
2. The total distance of the trip is 60 miles.
3. Henry's second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip.

To find out how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to calculate the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip, and then subtract the 15 miles before the end of the trip.

Distance from the first stop to the end of the trip:
60 miles (total distance) - 20 miles (distance traveled before the first stop)) = 20 miles

Now, subtract the 15 miles before the end of the trip:
20 miles (distance from the first stop to the end of the trip)) - 15 miles (distance before the end of the trip)) = 5 miles

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We know that one pair of heels costs $33.

2. The other pair of heels costs twice as much as the first pair. So, the second pair of heels costs $33 * 2 = $66.

3. Together, the two pairs of high heels cost $33 + $66 = $99.

4. The two pairs of high heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. So, the boots cost $99 + $5 = $104.

#### 109
[2024-12-31 14:07:18,633][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total parts of the ratio.
2. Calculate the value of one part.
3. Determine Allen's current age.
4. Calculate Allen's age 10 years from now.

Step 1: The total parts of the ratio are 7 (for Darrell) + 11 (for Allen) = 18 parts.

Step 2: The value of one part is calculated by dividing the total age by the total parts of the ratio. So, one part = 162 / 18 = 9.

Step 3: To determine Allen's current age, we multiply the number of parts representing Allen's age by the value of one part. So, Allen's current age = 11 parts * 9 = 99 years.

Step 4: To calculate Allen's age 10 years from now, we simply add 10 years to Allen's current age. So, Allen's age 10 years from now = 99 years + 10 years = 109 years.

[2024-12-31 14:07:39,223][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of jelly beans each friend guesses and then find the average of these guesses.

Let's denote the number of jelly beans the first friend guesses as \( J_1 \).

Given:
\( J_1 = 80 \)

The second friend guesses \( J_2 \), which is 20 more than half of the first one's guess. So we can write this as:

\( J_2 = \frac{J_1}{2} + 20}{1} \)

Substituting \( J_1 = 80 \) into the equation for \( J_2 \):

\( J_2 = \frac{80}{2} + 20}{1} \)

\( J_2 = \frac{40 + 20}{1} \)

\( J_2 = \frac{60}{1} \)

\( J_2 = 60 \)

The third friend guesses \( J_3 \), which is 25% more than the first one's guess. So we can write this as:

\( J_3 = J_1 + 0.25 \times J_1 \)

Substituting \( J_1 = 80 \) into the equation for \( J_3 \):

\( J_3 = 80 + 0.25 \times 80 \)

\( J_3 = 80 + 0.25 \times 80 \)

\( J_3 = 80 + 20 \)

\( J_3 = 100 \)

Now we have the guesses from each friend:

\( J_1 = 80 \)
\( J_2 = 60 \)
\( J_3 = 100 \)

To find the average guess, we add up all the guesses and divide by the number of guesses:

Average guess \( = \frac{J_1 + J_2 + J_3}{3} \)

Substituting the values we have:

Average guess \( = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} \)

Average guess \( = \frac{240}{3} \)

Average guess \( = \frac{240}{3} \)

Average guess \( = 80 \)

Gretchen has 40+30=<<40+30=70>>70 gold coins
#### 70
[2024-12-31 14:07:55,960][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations.

Let's denote the number of gold coins as G and the number of silver coins as S.

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:

1. The total number of coins is 110.
   This gives us the equation: G + S = 110.

2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.
   This gives us the equation: G = S + 30.

Now we can solve this system of equations.

From the second equation, we can express S in terms of G:
S = G - 30.

Now we can substitute this expression for S into the first equation:
G + (G - 30)) = 110.

Now we can simplify and solve for G:
2G - 30 = 110,
2G = 110 + 30,
2G = 140,
G = 140 / 2,
G = 70.

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

The answer: 70.

First, let's calculate the points Mike scored in the first 20 minutes. He scored 4 points.

Now, let's calculate the points Mike scored in the second 20 minutes. He scored 25% more points than he scored in the first 20 minutes.

To find 25% of the points scored in the first 20 minutes, we calculate 25% of 4 points:

25% of 4 = 0.25 * 4 = 1 point

So, Mike scored 25% more points than 4 points, which is:

4 points + 1 point = 5 points

Now, let's add the points scored in both intervals:

Points scored in the first 20 minutes: 4 points
Points scored in the second 20 minutes: 5 points

Total points scored: 4 points + 5 points = 9 points

2. John buys 8 video games for $20 each.
   Total money spent on video games = 8 games * $20/game = $160

3. John has $5 left after buying the video games.

Now, let's calculate how much money John had initially:

Total money from Lego sets = $195
Total money spent on video games = $160
Money left after buying video games = $5

Initial money = Money from Lego sets + Money spent on video games + Money left
Initial money = $195 + $160 + $5
Initial money = $360

Now, let's find out how many Lego sets John still has.

Since John sold all his Lego sets to buy video games, he does not have any Lego sets left.

The answer: 0.

[2024-12-31 14:08:39,110][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: He has 7-1=<<7-1=6>>6 possible running days.
He runs half of those so he runs 6/2=<<6/2=3>>3 days.
So for two days, he runs 3/2=<<3/2=1.5>>1.5 hours.
So in total, he runs 3+1.5+1.5=<<3+1.5+1.5=6>>6 hours.
So he runs 60/6=<<60/6=10>>10 mph.
#### 10
[2024-12-31 14:08:39,111][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
To find out how fast John runs, we need to calculate the total time he spends running each week and then divide the total distance by the total time.

Here's the breakdown:

1. Total distance per week: 60 miles

2. Total time spent running each week:

   - First day: 3 hours
   - Second day: 1.5 hours (half of the first day)
   - Third day: 1.5 hours (half of the first day)
   - Fourth day: 1.5 hours (half of the first day)

Total time per week = 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 10.5 hours

3. Speed = Distance / Time

Speed = 60 miles / 10.5 hours ≈ 5.71428571 miles per hour

The answer: 5.71428571.

[2024-12-31 14:08:51,990][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: If Dana can skip at half the speed she can run, then she can run at 3*2=<<3*2=6>>6 miles per hour.
And since she can run at a speed that is 4 times faster than she can walk, this means she can walk at 6/4=1.5 miles per hour.
If two-thirds of the time is spent walking, then she walks for 6*(2/3)=<<6*(2/3)=4>>4 hours.
If one-third of the time is spent running, then she runs for 6-4=<<6-4=2>>2 hours.
Thus, she runs for 2 hours at 6 miles per hour, or 2*6=<<2*6=12>>12 miles.
She walks for 4 hours at 1.5 miles per hour, or 4*1.5=<<4*1.5=6>>6 miles.
Thus, altogether, she travels 12+6=<<12+6=18>>18 miles.
#### 18
[2024-12-31 14:08:51,991][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller parts and then combine the results.

First, let's determine Dana's speeds for running, walking, and skipping.

1. Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour (mph).

2. Skipping speed is half the running speed, so the running speed is 3 mph * 2 = 6 mph.

3. The running speed is four times faster than walking speed, so the walking speed is 6 mph / 4 = 1.5 mph.

Now, let's calculate how much time Dana spends running and walking.

1. Dana spends one-third of the time running, so she spends 6 hours / 3 = 2 hours running.

2. Dana spends two-thirds of the time walking, so she spends 6 hours * 2/3 = 4 hours walking.

Now, let's calculate the distance Dana can travel in six hours, given the time she spends running and walking.

1. Distance traveled while running: 2 hours * 6 mph = 12 miles.

2. Distance traveled while walking: 4 hours * 1.5 mph = 9 miles.

Now, let's add the distances together to find the total distance Dana can travel in six hours.

Total distance = Distance running + Distance walking
Total distance = 12 miles + 9 miles
Total distance = 21 miles

The answer: 21.

Now let's calculate the ages step by step:

1. Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old.

2. Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone. 
   So, Ben's iPhone is 2 * 1 = 2 years old.

3. Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone.
   So, Brandon's iPhone is 4 * 2 = 8 years old.

1200 feet is beyond the 1000-foot reach of the dragon's flames by a distance of 1200-1000=<<1200-1000=200>>200 feet.
#### 200
[2024-12-31 14:09:07,287][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the maximum distance Polly can throw the javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone.

First, we know that without the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin for a distance of 400 feet.

When holding the sapphire gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin three times farther than when not holding the gemstone.

So, the distance Polly can throw the javelin with the gemstone is:

400 feet (without gemstone) * 3 (distance increase with gemstone) = 1200 feet.

Now, we need to calculate how far outside of the reach of the dragon's flames Polly could stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

The dragon's reach is 1000 feet. Since Polly can throw the javelin 1200 feet with the gemstone, she can stand 200 feet outside of the dragon's reach and still hit the dragon with the javelin.

The answer: 200.

If only 14 remained, then 40-14=<<40-14=26>>26 pieces of pie had been taken by guests.
#### 26
[2024-12-31 14:09:14,861][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of pie pieces that were originally available and then subtract the number of pieces that remained at the end of the evening.

1. Calculate the total number of pie pieces:
   Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies, and each pie was cut into 8 pieces.
   Total pieces = Number of pies × Number of pieces per pie
   Total pieces = 5 pies × 8 pieces per pie
   Total pieces = 40 pieces

2. Calculate the number of pieces taken by the guests:
   There were 14 pieces of pie remaining at the end of the evening.
   Pieces taken by guests = Total pieces - Remaining pieces
   Pieces taken by guests = 40 pieces - 14 pieces
   Pieces taken by guests = 26 pieces

The answer: 26.

[2024-12-31 14:09:30,951][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: If the total calorie target is 2000 and I have consumed 1800 calories then I have 2000-1800 = <<2000-1800=200>>200 calories left to eat
If each serving of chips has 250 calories and I only have 200 calories left to eat, then I can only eat 200/250 of a serving = 4/5 of a serving
We also know that a 300g bag of chips has 5 servings, hence each serving has 300g/5 = <<300/5=60>>60 grams
If I can only eat 4/5 of a serving, then I can eat only 60g * 4/5 = 240g/5 = 48 grams
#### 48
[2024-12-31 14:09:30,952][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total calories in the 300g bag of chips.
2. Calculate the number of calories you can consume from the chips without exceeding your daily calorie target.
3. Calculate the number of grams of chips you can eat based on the number of calories you can consume.

Let's start with step 1:

1. Total calories in the 300g bag of chips:
   - 250 calories per serving
   - 5 servings in a 300g bag
   - Total calories = 250 calories/serving * 5 servings = 1250 calories

Now, let's move on to step 2:

2. Number of calories you can consume from the chips:
   - Daily calorie target: 2000 calories
   - Calories already consumed: 1800 calories
   - Calories remaining for the day: 2000 calories - 1800 calories = 200 calories

Finally, let's move on to step 3:

3. Number of grams of chips you can eat based on the number of calories you can consume:
   - 1250 calories in the 300g bag
   - 200 calories you can consume
   - Ratio of calories in the bag to calories you can consume: 1250 calories / 200 calories = 6.25

   - Since there are 5 servings in the bag, and you can only consume 200 calories worth of chips, you can only eat 1 serving of chips (since 200 calories is 1/5th of the total calories in the bag).

Therefore, you can eat 60 grams of chips (since 60 grams is 1/5th of the 300g bag).

The answer: 60.

To calculate Charlie's net profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total revenue from selling the candles.
2. Calculate the total cost of making the candles.
3. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the net profit.

Let's calculate each step:

1. Total Revenue:
   - He sells each candle for $2.00.
   - He makes and sells 20 candles.
   - Total Revenue = $2.00/candle * 20 candles = $40.00

2. Total Cost:
   - The cost of supplies for one pound of beeswax and the wicks is $10.00.
   - He can make 10 candles from one pound of beeswax.
   - To make 20 candles, he will need 2 pounds of beeswax.
   - Total Cost = $10.00/pound * 2 pounds = $20.00

3. Net Profit:
   - Net Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
   - Net Profit = $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of articles Meredith wrote each day and then multiply that by the average time it takes her to write an article.

**Monday:**
Meredith wrote 5 articles.

**Tuesday:**
She wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday.
2/5 * 5 = 2 more articles than Monday.

So, on Tuesday, she wrote 5 (Monday's articles) + 2 (additional articles) = 7 articles.

**Wednesday:**
She wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday.
2 * 7 = 14 articles.

Now, let's calculate the total number of hours she spent writing articles in the three days.

**Monday:**
5 articles * 4 hours/article = 20 hours

**Tuesday:**
7 articles * 4 hours/article = 28 hours

**Wednesday:**
14 articles * 4 hours/article = 56 hours

Then, the total number of post-it notes she had when she left the store was 80+x.
And if she used 220 Post-it notes at work and had 23 left, then 80+x=220+23
Subtracting 80 from each side of the equation, we see that x=220+23-80=<<220+23-80=163>>163 Post-it notes.
#### 163
[2024-12-31 14:10:01,999][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many Post-it notes Candice had before she bought the package.

Let's break down the information given:

1. Candice started with 80 Post-it notes.
2. She placed a single Post-it note on each of 220 different cups of coffee.
3. She had 23 Post-it notes remaining overall.

First, let's calculate how many Post-it notes Candice used at work:

220 cups of coffee * 1 Post-it note per cup = 220 Post-it notes used

Now, let's calculate the total number of Post-it notes Candice had before she bought the package:

Post-it notes used at work + Post-it notes remaining overall = Total Post-it notes Candice had before she bought the package

220 Post-it notes used + 23 Post-it notes remaining = 243 Post-it notes

243 Post-it notes (total Candice had before buying the package) - 80 Post-it notes (initial amount Candice had) = 163 Post-it notes

Therefore, the package that Candice purchased contained 163 Post-it notes.

[2024-12-31 14:10:17,146][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: He bought 200 / 40 = <<200/40=5>>5 blue ties
So he bought 5 * 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 red ties
Each red tie cost $40 * .5 = $<<40*.5=20>>20 more than blue ties
So they each cost $40 + $20 = $<<40+20=60>>60
So he spent $60 * 10 = $<<60*10=600>>600 on red ties
So he spent $200 + $600 = $<<200+600=800>>800 on ties
#### 800
[2024-12-31 14:10:17,146][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
First, let's determine how many blue ties John bought. Since each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on blue ties, we can calculate the number of blue ties as follows:

Number of blue ties = Total spent on blue ties / Cost per blue tie
Number of blue ties = $200 / $40
Number of blue ties = 5

Now, let's determine how many red ties John bought. Since he buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, we can calculate the number of red ties as follows:

Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
Number of red ties = 2 * 5
Number of red ties = 10

Next, let's determine the cost of each red tie. Since the red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, we can calculate the cost of each red tie as follows:

Cost of each red tie = Cost per blue tie + (50% of Cost per blue tie))
Cost of each red tie = $40 + (0.5 * $40))
Cost of each red tie = $40 + ($20)
Cost of each red tie = $60

Now, let's calculate the total amount John spent on red ties:

Total spent on red ties = Number of red ties * Cost of each red tie
Total spent on red ties = 10 * $60
Total spent on red ties = $600

Finally, let's calculate the total amount John spent on ties:

Total spent on ties = Total spent on blue ties + Total spent on red ties
Total spent on ties = $200 + $600
Total spent on ties = $800

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of units in the building.
2. Calculate the number of occupied units.
3. Calculate the number of unoccupied units.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of units in the building.
There are 15 floors, and each floor contains 8 units.
Total units = Number of floors × Number of units per floor
Total units = 15 floors × 8 units/floor
Total units = 120 units

Step 2: Calculate the number of occupied units.
3/4 of the building is occupied.
Number of occupied units = Total units × Occupancy rate
Number of occupied units = 120 units × 3/4
Number of occupied units = 120 units × 0.75
Number of occupied units = 90 units

Step 3: Calculate the number of unoccupied units.
Number of unoccupied units = Total units - Number of occupied units
Number of unoccupied units = 120 units - 90 units
Number of unoccupied units = 30 units

Uriah wants to remove 15 pounds from his book bag. Since he has already removed 7.5 pounds with the comic books, he still needs to remove:

15 pounds - 7.5 pounds = 7.5 pounds

Now, let's calculate how many toys Uriah needs to remove to account for the remaining 7.5 pounds.

- Truck tires: 6 tires * $60/tire = $360
- Car tires: 4 tires * $40/tire = $160

Total revenue on Thursday = $360 (truck tires) + $160 (car tires)) = $520

**Friday Revenue:**
- Car tires: 12 tires * $40/tire = $480

Total revenue on Friday = $480 (car tires)

**Difference in Revenue:**
Difference = Revenue on Thursday - Revenue on Friday
Difference = $520 - $480 = $40

The answer: 40.

[2024-12-31 14:11:07,362][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: Patchy has just had 3 * 7 = <<3*7=21>>21 kittens
Since Trixie's kittens are 12, both cats have 21 +12 = <<21+12=33>>33 kittens.
Combining the adopted kittens with those from the two cats, the Doubtfire family now has 7 + 33 = <<7+33=40>>40 kittens.
#### 40
[2024-12-31 14:11:07,362][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of kittens each of the two house cats has had, and then add the number of adopted kittens to the total number of kittens.

Let's break it down:

1. Patchy has had thrice the number of adopted kittens. Since there are 7 adopted kittens, Patchy has had 3 * 7 = 21 kittens.

2. Trixie has had 12 kittens.

Now, let's add the number of adopted kittens to the total number of kittens:

Adopted kittens: 7
Patchy's kittens: 21
Trixie's kittens: 12

Total kittens = 7 (adopted) + 21 (Patchy) + 12 (Trixie))

Total kittens = 7 + 21 + 12
Total kittens = 50

The answer: 50.

First, we need to find out how many lollipops Jean has left after eating 2 of them.

Jean originally had 30 lollipops. After eating 2, Jean has:

30 - 2 = 28 lollipops left.

Now, Jean wants to package 2 lollipops in one bag. To find out how many bags Jean can fill, we divide the number of lollipops left by the number of lollipops per bag:

28 ÷ 2 = 14 bags.

The answer: 14.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of going to the movies once, and then divide Peter's total budget by this cost.

The cost of a movie ticket is $7.
The cost of popcorn is $7.

So, the total cost of going to the movies once is:

$7 (ticket) + $7 (popcorn) = $14

Now, we divide Peter's total budget of $42 by the cost of going to the movies once, which is $14.

$42 / $14 = 3

So, Peter can go to the movies 3 times with his budget of $42.

The answer: 3.

There can be 1245 / 15 = <<1245/15=83>>83 boxes loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit.
#### 83
[2024-12-31 14:11:29,413][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the weight limit of the bridge.
2. Subtract the weight of the driver and the empty truck from the weight limit of the bridge.
3. Divide the result from step 2 by the weight of one box.
4. The result from step 3 will give us the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck.

Now, let's calculate:

1. The weight limit of the bridge is 5000 pounds.

2. The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds. Subtracting this from the bridge's weight limit gives us:
5000 pounds - 3755 pounds = 1245 pounds

3. Each box weighs 15 pounds. Dividing the remaining weight (1245 pounds) by the weight of one box (15 pounds) gives us:
1245 pounds / 15 pounds per box = 83 boxes

Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit is 83 boxes.

The answer: 83.

#### 17
[2024-12-31 14:11:50,116][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
To determine how many oranges are good, we need to subtract the number of bad, unripe, sour, and other non-good oranges from the total number of oranges.

Here's the breakdown:

- Total oranges: 25
- Bad oranges: 1
- Unripe oranges: 20% of 25 = 0.20 * 25 = 5
- Sour oranges: 2
- Other non-good oranges: 0 (since there are no other non-good oranges mentioned)

Now, let's calculate the number of good oranges:

Good oranges = Total oranges - (Bad oranges + Unripe oranges + Sour oranges + Other non-good oranges))

Good oranges = 25 - (1 + 5 + 2 + 0))

Good oranges = 25 - (1 + 5 + 2))

Good oranges = 25 - (8)

Good oranges = 25 - 8

Good oranges = 17

To calculate the total amount Janet paid, we need to add the cost of the material, the cost of the jeweler's work, and the insurance cost.

1. Cost of material: $500
2. Cost of jeweler's work: $800
3. Insurance cost: 10% of the total cost of the material and the jeweler's work.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the material and the jeweler's work:

Total cost = Cost of material + Cost of jeweler's work
Total cost = $500 + $800
Total cost = $1300

Now, let's calculate the insurance cost:

Insurance cost = 10% of total cost
Insurance cost = 0.10 * $1300
Insurance cost = $130

Now, let's add up all the costs:

Total amount paid = Cost of material + Cost of jeweler's work + Insurance cost
Total amount paid = $500 + $800 + $130
Total amount paid = $1510

[2024-12-31 14:12:12,084][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: First find how many years Marcy works after 20 years: 30 years - 20 years = <<30-20=10>>10 years
Then multiply that number by the amount of her pension she gets per year: 10 years * 5% = 50%
Then multiply that percentage by the total amount of the full pension to find how much she gets: $50,000 * 50% = $<<50000*50*.01=25000>>25,000
#### 25000
[2024-12-31 14:12:12,085][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
To calculate Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to consider two parts of her pension:

1. The base annual pension, which is $50,000/year.

2. The additional pension she becomes entitled to after 20 years. This additional pension is 5% of the value of the pension per year.

Since Marcy is quitting after 30 years, we need to calculate the additional pension for the 10 years after she becomes entitled to the additional pension.

Here's the calculation:

1. Base annual pension: $50,000/year

2. Additional pension for 10 years (5% of $50,000/year):

   Additional pension per year = 5% of $50,000
   Additional pension per year = 0.05 * $50,000
   Additional pension per year = $2,500/year

   Additional pension for 10 years = $2,500/year * 10 years
   Additional pension for 10 years = $25,000

Now, we add the base annual pension to the additional pension for 10 years:

Annual pension after 30 years = Base annual pension + Additional pension for 10 years
Annual pension after 30 years = $50,000/year + $25,000
Annual pension after 30 years = $75,000/year

The answer: 75000.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount Aleena paid for each half of the year and then sum these amounts.

1. Calculate the amount for the first half of the year:
   - The first half of the year consists of 6 months.
   - The initial amount for the first half is $140 per month * 6 months = $840.

2. Calculate the amount for the second half of the year:
   - The second half of the year also consists of 6 months.
   - The streaming company charges 10% less for the second half.
   - 10% of $140 is $14.
   - Therefore, the reduced amount for the second half is $140 - $14 = $126 per month.
   - The total amount for the second half is $126 per month * 6 months = $756.

3. Calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the year:
   - Total amount = Amount for the first half + Amount for the second half
   - Total amount = $840 + $756 = $1596.

Sophia has traveled 100 miles on a certain amount of gas. She then refilled her tank with 4 gallons of gas, which filled up her 12-gallon tank.

First, we need to find out how many miles Sophia can drive on 1 gallon of gas. We do this by dividing the miles traveled by the gallons of gas used:

100 miles / 4 gallons = 25 miles per gallon

Now that we know Sophia's car can travel 25 miles on 1 gallon of gas, we can calculate how many miles she can drive on a full tank of 12 gallons:

They have also each sent 2 teams * 1 coach per team = <<2*1=2>>2 coaches.
In total, each school has sent 10 players + 2 coaches = <<10+2=12>>12 people.

1. Each school sends 2 teams (1 girls' team and 1 boys' team).
2. Each team has 5 players.
3. Each team also has 1 coach.

Now, let's calculate the total number of people sent by all the schools:

- Number of schools: 4
- Number of teams per school: 2
- Number of players per team: 5
- Number of coaches per team: 1

Total number of players = Number of schools * Number of teams per school * Number of players per team
Total number of players = 4 * 2 * 5 = 4 * 2 * 5 = 40

Total number of coaches = Number of schools * Number of teams per school * Number of coaches per team
Total number of coaches = 4 * 2 * 1 = 4 * 2 * 1 = 8

Total number of people sent = Total number of players + Total number of coaches
Total number of people sent = 40 + 8 = 48

2. Calculate the total number of students at the school.
3. Determine the number of teachers at the school.

Step 1: Number of boys
Since there are twice as many boys as girls, and there are 60 girls, we can calculate the number of boys as follows:

Number of boys = 2 * Number of girls
Number of boys = 2 * 60
Number of boys = 120

Step 2: Total number of students
To find the total number of students, we add the number of boys and girls together:

Total number of students = Number of boys + Number of girls
Total number of students = 120 + 60
Total number of students = 180

Step 3: Number of teachers
We are given that there are 5 students to every teacher. To find the number of teachers, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per teacher:

Number of teachers = Total number of students / Number of students per teacher
Number of teachers = 180 / 5
Number of teachers = 36

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Bailey received as her weekly allowance and then subtract that amount from the total amount she has at the end of the 8 weeks.

Bailey receives a weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks.

Total allowance received = Weekly allowance × Number of weeks
Total allowance received = $5 × 8
Total allowance received = $40

Bailey has a total of $100 at the end of the 8 weeks.

To find out how much money Bailey started with, we subtract the total allowance received from the total amount Bailey has at the end of the 8 weeks.

Money Bailey started with = Total amount Bailey has at the end of 8 weeks - Total allowance received
Money Bailey started with = $100 - $40
Money Bailey started with = $60

2. Calculate the total number of students in all classes for the week.
3. Calculate the total amount of money Judy makes from all the students in all classes for the week.

Let's calculate each step:

1. Each class has 15 students.
2. Judy teaches 5 dance classes on weekdays (Monday to Friday), which totals 5 classes/day * 5 days = 25 classes.
   On Saturday, she teaches 8 classes.
   So, the total number of classes in a week is 25 (weekdays) + 8 (Saturday) = 33 classes.
   The total number of students in all classes for the week is 33 classes * 15 students/class = 495 students.

[2024-12-31 14:13:30,779][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: The second recipe has 2 * 20 instructions = <<2*20=40>>40 instructions.
The total for the two dishes is 40 instructions + 20 instructions = <<40+20=60>>60 instructions.
#### 60
[2024-12-31 14:13:30,779][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of instructions in each recipe and then add those numbers together.

1. The first recipe has 20 instructions.

2. The second recipe has twice as many instructions as the first one. Since the first one has 20 instructions, the second one has 20 * 2 = 40 instructions.

Now, to find the total number of instructions Kelian has to read to prepare the two dishes, we add the number of instructions from both recipes:

20 (from the first recipe) + 40 (from the second recipe) = 60 instructions.

The answer: 60.

[2024-12-31 14:13:38,993][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: Tommy raised 43 brownies x $3/brownie = $<<43*3=129>>129 by selling brownies.
Tommy raised 23 slices x $4 = $<<23*4=92>>92 by selling cheesecakes.
In total Tommy has raised $129 + $92 = $<<129+92=221>>221
#### 221
[2024-12-31 14:13:38,993][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
To calculate the total amount of money Tommy raises, we need to multiply the number of brownies and cheesecake slices sold by the price per slice for each item.

For the brownies:
Number of brownies sold = 43
Price per slice of brownie = $3
Total money raised from brownies = 43 brownies * $3/brownie = $129

For the cheesecakes:
Number of cheesecake slices sold = 23
Price per slice of cheesecake = $4
Total money raised from cheesecakes = 23 slices * $4/slice = $92

Now, we add the total money raised from both the brownies and the cheesecakes.

Total money raised = Money raised from brownies + Money raised from cheesecakes
Total money raised = $129 + $92
Total money raised = $221

The answer: 221.

[2024-12-31 14:13:49,708][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: A $150 x 2/100 = $<<150*2/100=3>>3 interest will be charged for each unit.
So, each cell phone costs $150 + $3 = $<<150+3=153>>153.
The total amount to be paid for 5 cell phones is $153 x 5 = $<<153*5=765>>765.
Thus, Shiela will pay $765/3 = $<<765/3=255>>255 each month.
#### 255
[2024-12-31 14:13:49,709][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the cell phones including the interest, and then divide this total cost by the number of months.

Here's the breakdown:

1. Calculate the total cost of the cell phones without interest:
   Total cost without interest = Number of cell phones * Cost per cell phone
   Total cost without interest = 5 * $150
   Total cost without interest = $750

2. Calculate the total interest for all cell phones:
   Total interest = Total cost without interest * Interest rate
   Total interest = $750 * 2%
   Total interest = $750 * 0.02
   Total interest = $15

3. Calculate the total cost including interest:
   Total cost including interest = Total cost without interest + Total interest
   Total cost including interest = $750 + $15
   Total cost including interest = $765

4. Calculate the monthly payment for 3 months:
   Monthly payment = Total cost including interest / Number of months
   Monthly payment = $765 / 3
   Monthly payment = $255.67 (rounded to two decimal places)

The answer: 255.67.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total revenue from each type of flower, rounded to the nearest dollar. Then, we'll sum up the revenues from all the flowers.

1. Calculate the rounded price for each type of flower:
   - Marigolds: $2.74 rounded to $3.00.
   - Petunias: $1.87 rounded to $2.00.
   - Begonias: $2.12 rounded to $2.00.

2. Calculate the total revenue for each type of flower:
   - Marigolds: 12 pots * $3.00/pot = $36.00.
   - Petunias: 9 pots * $2.00/pot = $18.00.
   - Begonias: 17 pots * $2.00/pot = $34.00.

3. Sum up the total revenue from all the flowers:
   - Total Revenue = Revenue from Marigolds + Revenue from Petunias + Revenue from Begonias
   - Total Revenue = $36.00 + $18.00 + $34.00
   - Total Revenue = $88.00

[2024-12-31 14:14:10,621][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
To find the average square footage of a level in the sandcastle, we first need to determine the square footage of each level.

Given that the top level has a square footage of 16, and each level below has half the square footage of the level above it, we can calculate the square footage of each level as follows:

- Level 4 (top level): 16 square feet
- Level 3: 16 / 2 = 8 square feet
- Level 2: 8 / 2 = 4 square feet
- Level 1 (bottom level): 4 / 2 = 2 square feet

Now, to find the average square footage of a level, we add up the square footage of all levels and then divide by the number of levels.

The total square footage of all levels is:
16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 32 square feet

There are 4 levels in the sandcastle.

The average square footage of a level is:
32 / 4 = 8 square feet

[2024-12-31 14:14:23,374][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food the puppy will consume in the first year.

First, let's calculate the amount of dog food the puppy will consume in the first 180 days:

1 cup/day * 180 days = 180 cups

Next, let's calculate the amount of dog food the puppy will consume for the rest of its life. Since we don't know the exact duration of the puppy's life, we'll assume the puppy lives for an average of 10 years.

For the first 180 days, the puppy consumes 180 cups. For the remaining 10 years, the puppy will consume 2 cups/day * 365 days/year * 10 years = 69,000 cups.

Now, let's add the two amounts together to get the total amount of dog food the puppy will consume in the first year:

180 cups (first 180 days) + 69,000 cups (remaining 10 years) = 69,180 cups

Finally, let's calculate how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year:

69,180 cups / 110 cups/bag = 630.18 bags

Since we can't have a fraction of a bag, we'll round up to the nearest whole bag.

Therefore, Cecilia will use 631 bags of dog food in the first year.

The answer: 631.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of laundry each person does.

Let's denote the amount of laundry Sarah does as S. According to the problem, S = 400 pounds.

Now, let's denote the amount of laundry Raymond does as R. According to the problem, Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. Therefore, R = S/2 = 400/2 = 200 pounds.

Next, let's denote the amount of laundry David does as D. According to the problem, Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David. Therefore, D = S/4 = 400/4 = 100 pounds.

Now, we need to calculate the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do.

The difference is R - D = 200 - 100 = 100 pounds.

[2024-12-31 14:14:52,191][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at the better price, and then compare it to the cost of buying the flowers at the regular price.

First, let's determine the better price per flower. 

For the 3-flower package for $2.50, the cost per flower is $2.50 / 3 = $0.8333 per flower.

For the 2-flower package for $1, the cost per flower is $1 / 2 = $0.5 per flower.

The better price per flower is $0.5.

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at the better price:

Cost = Number of flowers * Cost per flower
Cost = 18 * $0.5
Cost = 9 * $1
Cost = $9

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at the regular price. Since we have two different regular prices, we need to calculate the cost for each type of package and then add them together.

For the 3-flower package for $2.50, we need to calculate how many of these packages Vincent would need to buy 18 flowers.

18 flowers / 3 flowers per package = 6 packages

Cost for 3-flower packages = 6 packages * $2.50 per package
Cost for 3-flower packages = $15

For the 2-flower package for $1, we need to calculate how many of these packages Vincent would need to buy 18 flowers.

18 flowers / 2 flowers per package = 9 packages

Cost for 2-flower packages = 9 packages * $1 per package
Cost for 2-flower packages = $9

Now, let's add the costs of the two types of packages together to get the total cost of buying 18 flowers at the regular price:

Total cost = Cost for 3-flower packages + Cost for 2-flower packages
Total cost = $15 + $9
Total cost = $24

Now, let's calculate how much money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price:

Savings = Total cost at regular price - Total cost at better price
Savings = $24 - $9
Savings = $15

The answer: 15.

So the two girls got a total of 4 x 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 liters.
Thus, a total of 8 + 6 = <<8+6=14>>14 liters of water were gotten by the two girls and the boy.
Therefore, 24 - 14 = <<24-14=10>>10 liters of water were left.
#### 10
[2024-12-31 14:15:04,903][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
First, let's calculate how much water each girl got. Since each girl got 1/6 of the 24 liters of water, we calculate:

1/6 * 24 liters = 4 liters

So, each girl got 4 liters of water. Since there are two girls, the total amount of water they got is:

2 girls * 4 liters/girl = 8 liters

Now, let's add the amount of water the boy got:

Boy's water = 6 liters

Now, let's calculate the total amount of water that was distributed:

Total distributed water = Girls' water + Boy's water
Total distributed water = 8 liters + 6 liters
Total distributed water = 14 liters

Now, let's calculate how much water was left:

Water left = Total water - Total distributed water
Water left = 24 liters - 14 liters
Water left = 10 liters

Starting stickers: 10
Stickers bought: +21
Stickers for birthday: +23
Stickers given to sister: -9
Stickers used for greeting card: -28

Total stickers left = 10 + 21 + 23 - 9 - 28

Total stickers left = 10 + 21 + 23 - 9 - 28
Total stickers left = 31 + 23 - 9 - 28
Total stickers left = 54 - 9 - 28
Total stickers left = 45 - 28

So, 2L = 22 - 8 = 14
So L = 14/2 = <<14/2=7>>7 losses.
Therefore, the team won 22 – 7 = <<22-7=15>>15 games.
#### 15
[2024-12-31 14:15:38,601][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Let's denote the number of games they lost as L. According to the problem, they won 8 more games than they lost. Therefore, the number of games they won is L + 8.

We also know that the total number of games played is 22. This means that the sum of the games they won and the games they lost is 22.

So, we have the equation:

L + (L + 8)) = 22

Now, let's solve for L:

2L + 8 = 22
2L = 22 - 8
2L = 14
L = 14 / 2
L = 7

So, they lost 7 games. Now, to find out how many games they won, we use the information that they won 8 more games than they lost:

Number of games won = L + 8
Number of games won = 7 + 8
Number of games won = 15

In three years, the total increase in her salary will be 3 years * $720/year = $<<3*720=2160>>2160
After three years, Sylvie will be paid $7200 + $2160 = $<<7200+2160=9360>>9360
#### 9360
[2024-12-31 14:16:03,148][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
To solve this problem, we need to calculate Sylvie's salary after each year of the 10% salary increase.

Let's start with Sylvie's initial salary:

Initial salary: $600

Now, let's calculate her salary after each year of the 10% salary increase.

Year 1:
10% increase of $600 = $60
New salary = $600 + $60 = $660

Year 2:
10% increase of $660 = $66
New salary = $660 + $66 = $726

Year 3:
10% increase of $726 = $72.60
New salary = $726 + $72.60 = $798.60

After three more years of service, Sylvie's annual salary will be $798.60.

The answer: 798.60.

[2024-12-31 14:16:10,479][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: Let m be the number of copies Marilyn sold and h be the number Harald sold. We know that m + h = 80,000 and m = 10h.
Substituting the second equation into the first, we get 10h + h = 88,000
Combining like terms, we get 11h = 88,000
Dividing both sides by 11, we get h = 8,000
#### 8000
[2024-12-31 14:16:10,480][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
Let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as \( H \).

According to the problem, Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's. So, Marilyn sold \( 10H \) copies.

The total number of copies sold by both Marilyn and Harald is 88,000. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ H + 10H = 88,000 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

To find \( H \), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} \]

\[ H = 8,000 \]

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies.

The answer: 8,000.

#### 24
[2024-12-31 14:16:22,164][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
First, we need to calculate how many guests will actually show up. Since 1/4 of attendees don't show up, we can calculate the number of guests who will show up:

Number of guests who will show up = Total number of invited guests × (1 - 1/4))

Number of guests who will show up = 16 × (1 - 1/4))
Number of guests who will show up = 16 × (1 - 0.25))
Number of guests who will show up = 16 × (0.75))
Number of guests who will show up = 16 × 0.75
Number of guests who will show up = 12

Now that we know 12 guests will show up, we can calculate how many gift bags Christina will need:

Number of gift bags needed = Number of guests who will show up × Number of gift bags per invited guest

Number of gift bags needed = 12 × 0.75
Number of gift bags needed = 9

Now that we know Christina will need 9 gift bags, we can calculate how much she will spend:

Total cost = Number of gift bags needed × Cost per gift bag

Total cost = 9 × $2
Total cost = $18

The answer: 18.

To feed 20 dinosaur adults, he will need 20*10=<<20*10=200>>200 pounds of potato salad.
To feed 5 dinosaur children, he will need 5*5=<<5*5=25>>25 pounds of potato salad.
In total, he will need to bring 200+25=<<200+25=225>>225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic.
#### 225
[2024-12-31 14:16:31,700][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of potato salad that will be consumed by the adults and children at the picnic.

First, let's calculate the amount of potato salad an adult will eat:
- An adult will eat 10 lbs of potato salad.

Next, let's calculate the amount of potato salad a child will eat:
- A child will eat half as much as an adult, which is 10 lbs / 2 = 5 lbs of potato salad.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of potato salad needed for the adults:
- 20 adults * 10 lbs/adult = 200 lbs of potato salad.

Next, let's calculate the total amount of potato salad needed for the children:
- 5 children * 5 lbs/child = 25 lbs of potato salad.

Finally, let's add the total amount of potato salad needed for the adults and children together:
- 200 lbs (for adults) + 25 lbs (for children) = 225 lbs of potato salad.

The answer: 225.

Let's break down the information given:

1. Cindy has four pets.
2. Marcia has two more pets than Cindy.
3. Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia.

Now, let's calculate the number of pets each person has:

1. Cindy has 4 pets.
2. Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy, so Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets.
3. Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, so Jan has 3 * 6 = 18 pets.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pets:

Total pets = Cindy's pets + Marcia's pets + Jan's pets
Total pets = 4 + 6 + 18
Total pets = 38

#### 36
[2024-12-31 14:16:52,841][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds.

2. Lee can run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald.

3. This means that Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds + 2 seconds = 40 seconds.

4. Gerald improved his speed by 10% due to his improved diet.

5. To find out how fast Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles with his improved diet, we need to calculate 10% of Gerald's original time.

6. 10% of 40 seconds is 4 seconds.

7. Therefore, with his improved diet, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in 40 seconds - 4 seconds = 36 seconds.

[2024-12-31 14:17:02,916][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: If there are two cats for every dog, and the number of dogs is 60, the number of cats is 2*60 = <<2*60=120>>120
The combined number of cats and dogs is 120+60 = <<120+60=180>>180
The number of rabbits pets is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats, a total of 180-12 = 168
The total number of pets in the compound is 168+180 = <<168+180=348>>348
#### 348
[2024-12-31 14:17:02,916][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of cats based on the number of dogs.
2. Determine the number of dogs and cats combined.
3. Determine the number of rabbits based on the information given.
4. Add up the number of rabbits, dogs, cats, and subtract the number of rabbits from the total to get the final number of pets.

Let's start with step 1:

1. Number of cats = 2 cats/dog * 60 dogs = 120 cats.

Now, let's move on to step 2:

2. Number of dogs and cats combined = 60 dogs + 120 cats = 180 pets.

Now, let's move on to step 3:

3. Number of rabbits = Number of dogs and cats combined - 12 = 180 pets - 12 = 168 pets.

Now, let's move on to step 4:

4. Total number of pets = Number of rabbits + Number of dogs and cats combined = 168 pets + 180 pets = 348 pets.

So, 200 - 80 = <<200-80=120>>120 are girls.
Out of the 120 girls, 120 x 2/3 = <<120*2/3=80>>80 are in the girl scout.
Therefore, 120 - 80 = <<120-80=40>>40 girls are not in the girl scout.
#### 40
[2024-12-31 14:17:13,932][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of boys.
2. Calculate the number of girls.
3. Calculate the number of girls in the girl scout.
4. Subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls to find the number of girls not in the girl scout.

Let's calculate each step:

1. Number of boys = 2/5 of 200 students
   = (2/5) * 200
   = (2/5) * 200
   = 2 * 40
   = 80 boys

2. Number of girls = Total students - Number of boys
   = 200 - 80
   = 120 girls

3. Number of girls in the girl scout = 2/3 of the girls
   = (2/3) * 120
   = 2 * 40
   = 80 girls in the girl scout

4. Number of girls not in the girl scout = Total number of girls - Number of girls in the girl scout
   = 120 - 80
   = 40 girls not in the girl scout.

[2024-12-31 14:17:21,909][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: James slept 9 hours * 2/3 = <<9*2/3=6>>6 hours.
So, Harry slept 9 - 6 = <<9-6=3>>3 hours more than James.
#### 3
[2024-12-31 14:17:21,909][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many hours James slept.

Harry slept 9 hours.

James slept 2/3 of what Harry slept. 

To find out how many hours James slept, we calculate 2/3 of 9 hours:

\( \frac{2}{3}} \times 9 = \frac{2 \times 9}{3}} = \frac{18}{3}} = 6 \) hours.

Now we know that James slept 6 hours.

To find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we subtract the number of hours James slept from the number of hours Harry slept:

\( 9 \text{ hours} (Harry) - 6 \text{ hours} (James) = 3 \text{ hours} \)

So, Harry slept 3 more hours than James.

At 16 ounces per can, she used 64 / 16 = <<64/16=4>>4 cans of tomatoes.
At 3 tomatoes a can, Freda used 3 * 4 = <<3*4=12>>12 tomatoes.
#### 12
[2024-12-31 14:17:30,819][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: 
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the volume of tomatoes used to make the sauce.
2. Calculate the number of tomatoes used based on the information given.

Step 1: The sauce made is 32 ounces. Since the tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked, the original volume of the tomatoes before cooking would be twice the volume of the sauce. 

So, the original volume of the tomatoes before cooking is:
32 ounces (sauce) * 2 = 64 ounces.

Step 2: Each 16-ounce can of tomatoes contains three tomatoes. To find out how many tomatoes are in 64 ounces, we first need to determine how many 16-ounce cans are in 64 ounces.

64 ounces / 16 ounces per can = 4 cans.

Now, we know that each can contains three tomatoes. So, for 4 cans:

4 cans * 3 tomatoes per can = 12 tomatoes.
