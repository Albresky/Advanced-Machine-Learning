#### 18
[2024-12-31 14:32:45,334][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: Janet starts with 16 eggs each day.  
She uses 3 eggs for breakfast, leaving her with 16 - 3 = 13 eggs.  
She then uses 4 eggs to bake muffins, leaving her with 13 - 4 = 9 eggs.  
She sells the remaining 9 eggs at $2 each, so she makes 9 * 2 = $18.

[2024-12-31 14:33:01,703][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: The cost of the house and repairs came out to 80,000+50,000=$<<80000+50000=130000>>130,000
He increased the value of the house by 80,000*1.5=<<80000*1.5=120000>>120,000
So the new value of the house is 120,000+80,000=$<<120000+80000=200000>>200,000
So he made a profit of 200,000-130,000=$<<200000-130000=70000>>70,000
#### 70000
[2024-12-31 14:33:01,703][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: Josh initially invests a total of $80,000 for the purchase of the house and an additional $50,000 for repairs, making his total investment $130,000. The repairs increase the value of the house by 150% of the purchase price. 

150% of $80,000 is $120,000. Therefore, the new value of the house is:
$80,000 (initial purchase) + $120,000 (increase) = $200,000.

To determine the profit, subtract the total investment from the new value:
$200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.

The answer: 70000.

[2024-12-31 14:33:09,899][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: Wendi has 20 chickens, and she feeds each chicken 3 cups of feed per day. Therefore, the total feed required per day is 20 chickens × 3 cups = 60 cups. She has already given 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon, totaling 40 cups. The remaining feed needed for the final meal is 60 cups - 40 cups = 20 cups. The answer: 20.

[2024-12-31 14:33:14,142][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: The discount price of one glass is 60/100 * 5 = $<<60/100*5=3>>3.
If every second glass is cheaper, that means Kylar is going to buy 16 / 2 = <<16/2=8>>8 cheaper glasses.
So for the cheaper glasses, Kylar is going to pay 8 * 3 = $<<8*3=24>>24.
And for the regular-priced glasses, Kylar will pay 8 * 5 = $<<8*5=40>>40.
So in total Kylar needs to pay 24 + 40 = $<<24+40=64>>64 for the glasses he wants to buy.
#### 64
[2024-12-31 14:33:14,143][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: To determine how much Kylar needs to pay for 16 glasses, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Cost of One Glass:** Each glass costs $5.
2. **Discount on Every Second Glass:** Every second glass costs 60% of the original price. 
   - 60% of $5 is calculated as 0.60 × $5 = $3.
3. **Cost for a Pair of Glasses:** 
   - First glass: $5
   - Second glass: $3
   - Total for two glasses: $5 + $3 = $8
4. **Total Number of Pairs:** Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, which means there are 16 ÷ 2 = 8 pairs.
5. **Total Cost:** 
   - Cost per pair: $8
   - Number of pairs: 8
   - Total cost: 8 × $8 = $64

The answer: 64.

Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, which is 2 * 80 sheep = <<2*80=160>>160 sheep
Together, the three has 20 sheep + 160 sheep + 80 sheep = <<20+160+80=260>>260 sheep
#### 260
[2024-12-31 14:33:18,501][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: Sure, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. **Seattle's sheep:** Seattle has 20 sheep.
2. **Charleston's sheep:** Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
   - Charleston = 4 × 20 = 80 sheep
3. **Toulouse's sheep:** Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.
   - Toulouse = 2 × 80 = 160 sheep
4. **Total sheep:** Add the number of sheep from Seattle, Charleston, and Toulouse together.
   - Total = 20 + 80 + 160 = 260 sheep

Then divide that number by the download rate to find the time until Windows restarts: 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = <<80/2=40>>40 minutes
Then find the time to download the whole file after the restart: 200 GB / 2 GB/minute = <<200/2=100>>100 minutes
Then add the time to download 40% of the file, to download the whole file, and to wait for Windows to update: 40 minutes + 100 minutes + 20 minutes = <<40+100+20=160>>160 minutes
#### 160
[2024-12-31 14:33:23,876][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: Carla needs to download a 200 GB file at a rate of 2 GB per minute. Normally, this would take:

200 GB ÷ 2 GB/minute = 100 minutes

However, when she has downloaded 40% of the file:

40% of 200 GB = 80 GB

This takes:

80 GB ÷ 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes

At this point, Windows forces a restart to install updates, which takes an additional 20 minutes. After the restart, Carla has to start downloading the entire 200 GB file again, which takes another 100 minutes.

Adding these times together:

40 minutes (initial download) + 20 minutes (restart) + 100 minutes (re-download) = 160 minutes

The answer: 160.

He then drives another 2-.5=<<2-.5=1.5>>1.5 hours
In that time he goes 80*1.5=<<80*1.5=120>>120 miles
So he drove 120+15=<<120+15=135>>135 miles
So he is 180-135=<<180-135=45>>45 miles away from home
#### 45
[2024-12-31 14:33:28,776][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: John initially drives away from home for 3 hours at 60 mph, covering a distance of:
3 hours * 60 mph = 180 miles.

He then turns around to return home and spends a total of 4 hours trying to get back:
- First 2 hours are spent in standstill traffic, covering 0 miles.
- Next 0.5 hours driving at 30 mph covers:
0.5 hours * 30 mph = 15 miles.
- Remaining 1.5 hours driving at 80 mph covers:
1.5 hours * 80 mph = 120 miles.

Total distance traveled towards home:
15 miles + 120 miles = 135 miles.

Initial distance from home was 180 miles, so the remaining distance from home is:
180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles.

Her hourly rate for the overtime pay is $10 x 1.2 = $<<10*1.2=12>>12.
So, Eliza will receive $12 x 5 =$<<12*5=60>>60 for overtime pay.
Her regular weekly earning is $10 x 40 = $<<10*40=400>>400.
Thus, Eliza will receive a total of $400 + $60 = $<<400+60=460>>460 for this week's work.
#### 460
[2024-12-31 14:33:31,879][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: Eliza worked a total of 45 hours this week. 

1. **Regular Hours:**  
   She worked 40 regular hours.  
   Regular pay = 40 hours × $10/hour = $400.

2. **Overtime Hours:**  
   She worked 5 overtime hours (45 total hours - 40 regular hours).  
   Overtime rate = 1.2 × $10/hour = $12/hour.  
   Overtime pay = 5 hours × $12/hour = $60.

3. **Total Earnings:**  
   Total earnings = Regular pay + Overtime pay = $400 + $60 = $460.

#### 13
[2024-12-31 14:33:44,362][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money from the lemon tree, let's break down the costs and revenues:

1. **Initial Cost:** The tree costs $90 to plant.

2. **Annual Revenue:** 
   - Each year, the tree produces 7 lemons.
   - Each lemon sells for $1.5.
   - Annual revenue = 7 lemons * $1.5 = $10.5 per year.

3. **Annual Cost:** 
   - It costs $3 each year to water and feed the tree.

4. **Total Cost Over Y Years:** 
   - Initial cost + (Annual cost * Y) = $90 + ($3 * Y).

5. **Total Revenue Over Y Years:** 
   - Annual revenue * Y = $10.5 * Y.

6. **Break-Even Point:** 
   - Set total revenue equal to total cost:
     \[
     10.5Y = 90 + 3Y
     \]
   - Subtract 3Y from both sides:
     \[
     7.5Y = 90
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 7.5:
     \[
     Y = 12
     \]

It will take **12 years** for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

The answer: 12.

If he purchases electronic gadgets, he will make a profit of 1.2% which is $8000*(1.2/100) = $<<8000*(1.2/100)=96>>96
If he wants to maximize profit, since $125 > $96, he will choose to purchase jewelry, thereby making a profit of $<<125=125>>125
#### 125
[2024-12-31 14:33:58,702][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: To determine which purchase option maximizes the merchant's profit, let's evaluate both choices:

1. **Jewelry Purchase:**
   - **Investment Amount:** $5,000
   - **Market Increase:** 2.5%
   - **Profit Calculation:** 
     \( \$5,000 \times 0.025 = \$125 \)

2. **Electronic Gadgets Purchase:**
   - **Investment Amount:** $8,000
   - **Market Increase:** 1.2%
   - **Profit Calculation:** 
     \( \$8,000 \times 0.012 = \$96 \)

Comparing the two profits:
- Jewelry yields a profit of \$125.

1. **Daily Egg Consumption:** Claire uses 3 eggs every morning for her omelet.
2. **Weekly Egg Consumption:** There are 7 days in a week, so in one week, she uses:
   \[
   3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 21 \text{ eggs}
   \]
3. **Four-Week Egg Consumption:** Over 4 weeks, she uses:
   \[
   21 \text{ eggs/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ eggs}
   \]
4. **Dozens of Eggs:** There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so the number of dozens she uses is:
   \[
   \frac{84 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 7 \text{ dozens}
   \]

Next subtract the time Marissa already spent walking to find out how much time she has left: 3 hours - 1 hour - 1 hour = <<3-1-1=1>>1 hour
Now figure out how much distance she has left by subtracting the distance she already traveled from the total distance: 12 miles - 4 miles - 2 miles = <<12-4-2=6>>6 miles
Now divide the remaining distance by the remaining time to find out how fast in miles per hour Marissa has to travel: 6 miles / 1 hour = <<6/1=6>>6 mph
#### 6
[2024-12-31 14:34:19,012][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: Marissa wants to complete a 12-mile trail with an average speed of 4 miles per hour. 

First, calculate the total time she has to finish the trail:
Total time = Total distance / Average speed = 12 miles / 4 mph = 3 hours.

She has already spent 2 hours walking the first 6 miles (1 hour for the first 4 miles and another hour for the next 2 miles).

Remaining time = Total time - Time already spent = 3 hours - 2 hours = 1 hour.

Remaining distance = Total distance - Distance already walked = 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles.

To cover the remaining 6 miles in 1 hour, her required speed is:
Speed = Distance / Time = 6 miles / 1 hour = 6 mph.

The answer: 6.

Out of the 9 liters, 9 x 2/3 = <<9*2/3=6>>6 liters are water.
Thus, there are a total of 9 + 6 = <<9+6=15>>15 liters of water out of the 24 liters.
#### 15
[2024-12-31 14:34:24,097][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Orange Drink:**
   - Total volume: 10 liters
   - Water content: two-thirds of 10 liters = (2/3) * 10 = 6.666... liters
   - Since 1 liter is spilled, the remaining orange drink poured is 10 - 1 = 9 liters.
   - Water in the poured orange drink: (2/3) * 9 = 6 liters

2. **Pineapple Drink:**
   - Total volume: 15 liters
   - Water content: three-fifths of 15 liters = (3/5) * 15 = 9 liters

3. **Total Mixture:**
   - Total volume poured: 9 liters (orange) + 15 liters (pineapple) = 24 liters
   - Total water in the mixture: 6 liters (from orange) + 9 liters (from pineapple) = 15 liters

Four apples cost $1.50 x 4 = $<<1.5*4=6>>6.
The total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples is $12 + $15 + $6 = $<<12+15+6=33>>33.
Thus, the boxes of pizza cost $50 - $33 = $<<50-33=17>>17.
Therefore, Marie ordered $17/$8.50 = <<17/8.5=2>>2 boxes of pizza.
#### 2
[2024-12-31 14:34:41,942][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: Let's solve the problem step by step:

Marie ordered:
- 1 chicken meal at $12.
- 5 packs of milk at $3 each.
- 4 apples at $1.50 each.
- Some boxes of pizza at $8.50 each.

First, calculate the total cost of the chicken meal:
1 * $12 = $12.

Next, calculate the cost of the milk:
5 * $3 = $15.

Then, calculate the cost of the apples:
4 * $1.50 = $6.

Let the number of pizza boxes be x. The cost of the pizza is:
x * $8.50.

Now, add up all the costs and set it equal to the total amount paid:
$12 + $15 + $6 + $8.50x = $50.

Combine the known amounts:
$12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

So, the equation becomes:
$33 + $8.50x = $50.

Subtract $33 from both sides:
$8.50x = $17.

Finally, solve for x:
x = $17 / $8.50
x = 2.

The answer: 2.

[2024-12-31 14:35:47,189][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: If Dana can skip at half the speed she can run, then she can run at 3*2=<<3*2=6>>6 miles per hour.
And since she can run at a speed that is 4 times faster than she can walk, this means she can walk at 6/4=1.5 miles per hour.
If two-thirds of the time is spent walking, then she walks for 6*(2/3)=<<6*(2/3)=4>>4 hours.
If one-third of the time is spent running, then she runs for 6-4=<<6-4=2>>2 hours.
Thus, she runs for 2 hours at 6 miles per hour, or 2*6=<<2*6=12>>12 miles.
She walks for 4 hours at 1.5 miles per hour, or 4*1.5=<<4*1.5=6>>6 miles.
Thus, altogether, she travels 12+6=<<12+6=18>>18 miles.
#### 18
[2024-12-31 14:35:47,190][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: Dana's skipping speed is 3 miles per hour. Since skipping is half as fast as running, her running speed is 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour. Her walking speed is one-fourth of her running speed, which is 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour. Over six hours, she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds walking. That means she runs for 2 hours and walks for 4 hours. The distance she runs is 6 mph * 2 hours = 12 miles. The distance she walks is 1.5 mph * 4 hours = 6 miles. Therefore, the total distance she travels is 12 + 6 = 18 miles. The answer: 18.

[2024-12-31 14:35:56,720][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: To determine how far outside the dragon's flame reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin, follow these steps:

1. **Dragon's Flame Reach:** 1000 feet.
2. **Normal Throw Distance:** 400 feet.
3. **Enhanced Throw with Gemstone:** 3 times the normal distance, which is 3 * 400 = 1200 feet.
4. **Maximum Distance Polly Can Throw:** 1200 feet.
5. **To Stay Outside the Dragon's Flame Reach:** Polly must stand beyond 1000 feet.
6. **Calculation of Extra Distance:** 1200 (throw distance) - 1000 (flame reach) = 200 feet.

Thus, Polly can stand 200 feet outside of the dragon's flame reach and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

The answer: 200.

If each serving of chips has 250 calories and I only have 200 calories left to eat, then I can only eat 200/250 of a serving = 4/5 of a serving
We also know that a 300g bag of chips has 5 servings, hence each serving has 300g/5 = <<300/5=60>>60 grams
If I can only eat 4/5 of a serving, then I can eat only 60g * 4/5 = 240g/5 = 48 grams
#### 48
[2024-12-31 14:36:02,427][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: To determine how many grams of chips you can consume without exceeding your daily calorie target, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate Remaining Calories:**
   - Daily calorie target: 2000 calories
   - Calories already consumed: 1800 calories
   - Remaining calories: 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories

2. **Determine Calories per Serving:**
   - Calories per serving: 250 calories

3. **Calculate the Number of Servings You Can Have:**
   - Number of servings = Remaining calories / Calories per serving
   - Number of servings = 200 / 250 = 0.8 servings

4. **Find Out Grams per Serving:**
   - Total bag weight: 300g
   - Number of servings in the bag: 5
   - Grams per serving = 300g / 5 = 60g

5. **Calculate Total Grams You Can Eat:**
   - Total grams = Number of servings * Grams per serving
   - Total grams = 0.8 * 60g = 48g

The answer: 48.

[2024-12-31 14:36:08,106][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: To determine Charlie's net profit from selling 20 beeswax candles, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of pounds of beeswax needed:**
   - Charlie can make 10 candles per pound of beeswax.
   - To make 20 candles: 
     \[ \frac{20 \text{ candles}}{10 \text{ candles/pound}} = 2 \text{ pounds} \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of supplies:**
   - Cost per pound of beeswax and wicks: $10.00
   - For 2 pounds:
     \[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10.00/\text{pound} = \$20.00 \]

3. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the candles:**
   - Selling price per candle: $2.00
   - For 20 candles:
     \[ 20 \text{ candles} \times \$2.00/\text{candle} = \$40.00 \]

4. **Determine the net profit:**
   \[ \text{Net Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} \]
   \[ \text{Net Profit} = \$40.00 - \$20.00 = \$20.00 \]

The answer: 20.

Each red tie cost $40 * .5 = $<<40*.5=20>>20 more than blue ties
So they each cost $40 + $20 = $<<40+20=60>>60
So he spent $60 * 10 = $<<60*10=600>>600 on red ties
So he spent $200 + $600 = $<<200+600=800>>800 on ties
#### 800

He spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each. 

Number of blue ties = $200 / $40 = 5.

Number of red ties = 2 * 5 = 10.

Red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, so each red tie costs $40 + (50% of $40) = $60.

Amount spent on red ties = 10 * $60 = $600.

Total amount spent on ties = $200 (blue ties) + $600 (red ties) = $800.

[2024-12-31 14:36:38,926][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: 30 comic books weigh 7.5 pounds because 30 x .25 = <<30*.25=7.5>>7.5
He needs to remove 7.5 more pounds because 15 - 7.5 = <<15-7.5=7.5>>7.5
He needs to remove 15 toys because 7.5 / .5 = <<15=15>>15
#### 15
[2024-12-31 14:36:38,926][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds. He removes 30 comic books, each weighing 1/4 pound. 

Total weight removed by comic books: 30 * 1/4 = 7.5 pounds.

Remaining weight to remove: 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound. Number of toys to remove: 7.5 / 0.5 = 15.

The answer: 15.

[2024-12-31 14:36:44,712][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: On Thursday the mechanic charged a total of 6*60 + 4*40 = $<<6*60+4*40=520>>520.
On Friday the mechanic charged a total of 12*40 = $<<12*40=480>>480.
Thus, on Thursday, the day with higher revenue, the mechanic had 520-480 = $<<520-480=40>>40 more revenue than on Friday.
#### 40
[2024-12-31 14:36:44,712][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: To determine how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, let's calculate the revenue for both Thursday and Friday.

**Thursday:**
- Truck tires repaired: 6
  - Revenue from truck tires: 6 * $60 = $360
- Car tires repaired: 4
  - Revenue from car tires: 4 * $40 = $160
- **Total revenue on Thursday:** $360 + $160 = $520

**Friday:**
- Truck tires repaired: 0
  - Revenue from truck tires: 0 * $60 = $0
- Car tires repaired: 12
  - Revenue from car tires: 12 * $40 = $480
- **Total revenue on Friday:** $0 + $480 = $480

**Difference in revenue:**
$520 (Thursday) - $480 (Friday) = $40

The answer: 40.

Then multiply that number by the amount of her pension she gets per year: 10 years * 5% = 50%
Then multiply that percentage by the total amount of the full pension to find how much she gets: $50,000 * 50% = $<<50000*50*.01=25000>>25,000
#### 25000
[2024-12-31 14:37:25,304][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: To determine Marcy's annual pension after quitting at 30 years, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total Years of Service**: 30 years.
2. **Years Eligible for Increased Pension**: Starting after 20 years, so 30 - 20 = 10 years.
3. **Annual Pension Increment**: 5% of the full pension per eligible year.
4. **Full Pension Amount**: $50,000 per year.
5. **Total Increment**: 10 years * 5% * $50,000 = 10 * 0.05 * 50,000 = $25,000.

Therefore, Marcy's annual pension after 30 years of service would be $25,000.

[2024-12-31 14:37:30,788][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: A year has twelve months, so a half of the year is 12/2 = <<12/2=6>>6 months,
For the first six months, the streaming service charged her a total of 6*140 = $<<6*140=840>>840
For the next half of the year, the streaming service company charged her 10/100*140 = $<<10/100*140=14>>14 less
She paid $140-$14 = $<<140-14=126>>126 each month for the remaining half of the year,
In total, she paid 126*6 = $<<126*6=756>>756 for the other half of the year for the streaming service.
The total amount of money she paid at the end of the year is $840+$756 = $<<840+756=1596>>1596
#### 1596
[2024-12-31 14:37:30,788][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: First, determine the number of months in the first half of the year, which is 6 months.  
Multiply the monthly charge by these months: 6 * 140 = 840.

Next, calculate the reduced monthly charge for the second half of the year.  
10% of 140 is 14, so the reduced charge is 140 - 14 = 126.  
Multiply this by the number of months: 6 * 126 = 756.

Finally, add the amounts from both halves of the year: 840 + 756 = 1596.

[2024-12-31 14:37:55,786][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. Let the amount of money Bailey starts with be \( x \).
2. She receives a weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks. So, the total allowance she receives is \( 5 \times 8 = \$40 \).
3. The total amount of money Bailey has after 8 weeks is the sum of her starting amount and her total allowance: \( x + 40 = 100 \).
4. To find the starting amount \( x \), subtract $40 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   x = 100 - 40 = 60

#### 60
[2024-12-31 14:38:23,154][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: Sure, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the levels:** There are 4 levels in the sandcastle, with Level 4 being the top level.

2. **Given information:** 
   - Level 4 (top level) has a square footage of 16.

3. **Determine the square footage for each lower level:** 
   - Each lower level has twice the square footage of the level above it.
   - Level 3 = Level 4 × 2 = 16 × 2 = 32
   - Level 2 = Level 3 × 2 = 32 × 2 = 64
   - Level 1 (bottom level) = Level 2 × 2 = 64 × 2 = 128

4. **Calculate the total square footage:** 
   - Total = Level 1 + Level 2 + Level 3 + Level 4 = 128 + 64 + 32 + 16 = 240

5. **Find the average square footage per level:** 
   - Average = Total square footage ÷ Number of levels = 240 ÷ 4 = 60

[2024-12-31 14:38:29,395][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: Cecilia needs to feed her puppy for a total of 365 days in the first year. For the first 180 days, the puppy consumes 1 cup of dog food each day, which totals 180 cups. For the remaining 185 days, the puppy consumes 2 cups each day, totaling 370 cups. 

Adding these together, the total amount of dog food needed for the first year is:
180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups.

Since one bag contains 110 cups, the number of bags Cecilia will use is:
550 cups / 110 cups per bag = 5 bags.

So, 2L = 22 - 8 = 14

Therefore, the team won 22 – 7 = <<22-7=15>>15 games.
#### 15
[2024-12-31 14:39:02,799][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: Let's solve the problem step by step.

1. Let \( W \) be the number of games won and \( L \) be the number of games lost.
2. According to the problem, the total number of games played is 22. So, we have:
   \[
   W + L = 22
   \]
3. It is also given that the team won 8 more games than they lost:
   \[
   W = L + 8
   \]
4. Substitute the second equation into the first equation:
   \[
   (L + 8) + L = 22
   \]
5. Combine like terms:
   \[
   2L + 8 = 22
   \]
6. Subtract 8 from both sides:
   \[
   2L = 14
   \]
7. Divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   L = 7
   \]
8. Now, find \( W \) using \( W = L + 8 \):
   \[
   W = 7 + 8 = 15

[2024-12-31 14:39:36,670][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: She needs 12 gift bags because 16 x .75 = <<16*.75=12>>12
She will spend $24 because 12 x 2 = <<12*2=24>>24
#### 24
[2024-12-31 14:39:36,670][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: Step 1: Calculate the expected number of attendees.
Since 1/4 of the invited friends don't show up, 3/4 are expected to attend.
16 friends * (3/4) = 12 attendees.

Step 2: Determine the number of gift bags needed.
12 attendees * 0.75 gift bags per attendee = 9 gift bags.

Step 3: Calculate the total cost.
9 gift bags * $2 each = $18.

The answer: 18.

[2024-12-31 14:39:41,353][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: Half of 10 pounds is 10/2=<<10/2=5>>5 pounds.
To feed 20 dinosaur adults, he will need 20*10=<<20*10=200>>200 pounds of potato salad.
To feed 5 dinosaur children, he will need 5*5=<<5*5=25>>25 pounds of potato salad.
In total, he will need to bring 200+25=<<200+25=225>>225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic.
#### 225
[2024-12-31 14:39:41,354][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: To determine the total amount of potato salad Ted needs to bring, we can calculate the consumption for adults and children separately.

Each adult dinosaur eats 10 pounds of potato salad. With 20 adults, they will consume:
20 adults * 10 lbs/adult = 200 lbs

Each child dinosaur eats half as much as an adult, which is:
10 lbs / 2 = 5 lbs per child
With 5 children, they will consume:
5 children * 5 lbs/child = 25 lbs

Adding both amounts together:
200 lbs (adults) + 25 lbs (children) = 225 lbs

The answer: 225.

Jan has 3 * 6 = <<3*6=18>>18 pets
In total, the three have 4 + 6 + 18 = <<4+6+18=28>>28 pets.
#### 28
[2024-12-31 14:39:44,756][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: Cindy has 4 pets.  
Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy, so Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets.  
Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, so Jan has 3 × 6 = 18 pets.  
The total number of pets is 4 + 6 + 18 = 28.  
The answer: 28.

[2024-12-31 14:39:49,524][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: James is 10 and 1 year younger than Corey, so Corey is 10 + 1 = <<10+1=11>>11 years old
Amy is 2 years younger than Corey so is 11 - 2 = 9 years old
Amy is also 5 years older than Jackson, so Jackson is 9 - 5 = <<9-5=4>>4 years old
#### 4
[2024-12-31 14:39:49,524][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: Let's analyze the information step by step:

1. **Amy is 5 years older than Jackson.**
   - Let Jackson's age be J.
   - Therefore, Amy's age is J + 5.

2. **Amy is 2 years younger than Corey.**
   - Amy's age is also equal to Corey's age minus 2.
   - So, J + 5 = Corey - 2.
   - Solving for Corey's age: Corey = J + 5 + 2 = J + 7.

3. **James is 10 years old and is 1 year younger than Corey.**
   - James's age is 10.
   - Corey is 1 year older than James: Corey = 10 + 1 = 11.

4. **Substitute Corey's age back to find Jackson's age:**
   - From step 2: Corey = J + 7.
   - We found Corey = 11, so: 11 = J + 7.
   - Solving for J: J = 11 - 7 = 4.

The answer: 4.

[2024-12-31 14:39:54,109][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: If Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, which was two seconds faster than Gerald used to run the 400-meter hurdles, then Gerald initially would run the 400-meter hurdles in 38+2=<<38+2=40>>40 seconds.
10% of 40 seconds is 40*0.1=<<40*0.1=4>>4 seconds.
The improved diet reduced Gerald's race time to 40-4=<<40-4=36>>36 seconds.
#### 36
[2024-12-31 14:39:54,109][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: Gerald's original time was 40 seconds. After a 10% speed increase, his new speed is 11 m/s. Therefore, his new time is 400 / 11 ≈ 36.36 seconds. The answer: 36.36.

[2024-12-31 14:39:59,033][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: If there are two cats for every dog, and the number of dogs is 60, the number of cats is 2*60 = <<2*60=120>>120
The combined number of cats and dogs is 120+60 = <<120+60=180>>180
The number of rabbits pets is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats, a total of 180-12 = 168
The total number of pets in the compound is 168+180 = <<168+180=348>>348
#### 348
[2024-12-31 14:39:59,033][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: Step 1: Number of dogs = 60.

Step 2: There are two cats for every dog, so number of cats = 2 × 60 = 120.

Step 3: Combined number of dogs and cats = 60 + 120 = 180.

Step 4: Number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats, so rabbits = 180 - 12 = 168.

Step 5: Total number of pets = dogs + cats + rabbits = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348.

The answer: 348.

So, 200 - 80 = <<200-80=120>>120 are girls.
Out of the 120 girls, 120 x 2/3 = <<120*2/3=80>>80 are in the girl scout.
Therefore, 120 - 80 = <<120-80=40>>40 girls are not in the girl scout.
#### 40
[2024-12-31 14:40:03,614][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: Total number of students = 200

Number of boys = (2/5) * 200 = 80

Number of girls = 200 - 80 = 120

Number of girls in girl scout = (2/3) * 120 = 80

Number of girls not in girl scout = 120 - 80 = 40

The answer: 40.

So, Harry slept 9 - 6 = <<9-6=3>>3 hours more than James.
#### 3
[2024-12-31 14:40:06,934][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: Harry slept 9 hours last night. James slept 2/3 of what Harry slept. To find out how many hours James slept, multiply 9 by 2/3:

9 * (2/3) = 6 hours.

To determine how many more hours Harry slept than James, subtract the hours James slept from the hours Harry slept:

9 - 6 = 3 hours.

[2024-12-31 14:40:12,076][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: Tomatoes lose half their volume when made into sauce, so Freda started with 32 * 2 = <<32*2=64>>64 ounces of tomatoes.
At 16 ounces per can, she used 64 / 16 = <<64/16=4>>4 cans of tomatoes.
At 3 tomatoes a can, Freda used 3 * 4 = <<3*4=12>>12 tomatoes.
#### 12
[2024-12-31 14:40:12,077][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: First, determine the initial volume of tomatoes before cooking. Since cooking reduces the volume by half, the initial volume is twice the final volume:

Initial volume = 2 * 32 ounces = 64 ounces.

Next, find out how many 16-ounce cans are needed to make up 64 ounces:

Number of cans = 64 ounces / 16 ounces per can = 4 cans.

Each can contains 3 tomatoes, so the total number of tomatoes used is:

Total tomatoes = 4 cans * 3 tomatoes per can = 12 tomatoes.

The answer: 12.

[2024-12-31 14:40:15,695][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: The cars that exited do not need to be included so there were 30 original cars – 5 cars that exited = <<30-5=25>>25 cars that drove through the traffic jam.
Most of the cars exited in the final 15 minutes so in the first 15 minutes, there must have been 25 total cars – 20 cars that drove through in the final 15 minutes = 5 cars that drove through the traffic jam.
#### 5
[2024-12-31 14:40:15,695][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. **Total cars on the motorway initially:** 30.
2. **Cars taking the exit:** 5.
3. **Cars remaining to drive through the traffic jam:** 30 - 5 = 25.
4. **Cars driving through the jam in the first 15 minutes:** Let's denote this number as x.
5. **Cars driving through the jam in the next 15 minutes:** 20.
6. **Total cars that drove through the traffic jam:** x + 20 = 25.
7. **Solving for x:** x = 25 - 20 = 5.

The answer: 5.
