[2024-12-31 14:25:19,432][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: Janet sells 16 - 3 - 4 = <<16-3-4=9>>9 duck eggs a day.
She makes 9 * 2 = $<<9*2=18>>18 every day at the farmer’s market.
#### 18
[2024-12-31 14:25:19,432][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: To find out how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we can break it down step by step.

1. **Total eggs laid daily by Janet’s ducks**: Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day.

2. **Eggs consumed by Janet for breakfast**: She eats 3 eggs for breakfast each morning.

3. **Eggs used for baking muffins**: She uses 4 eggs to bake muffins for her friends.

4. **Calculate the total number of eggs consumed and used**: 
   - Total eggs consumed and baked = 3 (for breakfast) + 4 (for muffins) = 7 eggs.

5. **Calculate the remaining eggs after breakfast and baking**: 
   - Remaining eggs = Total eggs laid - Eggs consumed and used = 16 - 7 = 9 eggs.

6. **Calculate Janet's earnings at the farmers' market**: 
   - Janet sells the remaining 9 eggs for $2 each.
   - Total earnings = 9 eggs * $2/egg = $18.

Therefore, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market.

The answer: 18.

[2024-12-31 14:25:21,656][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: It takes 2/2=<<2/2=1>>1 bolt of white fiber
So the total amount of fabric is 2+1=<<2+1=3>>3 bolts of fabric
#### 3
[2024-12-31 14:25:21,657][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: To find the total number of bolts needed for the robe, we first need to determine how much white fiber is used. Since the robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that amount in white fiber, we calculate the white fiber as follows:

Half of 2 bolts (blue fiber) is 1 bolt (white fiber).

Now, we add the amounts of blue and white fiber together:

2 bolts (blue fiber) + 1 bolt (white fiber) = 3 bolts in total.

Therefore, the total number of bolts needed for the robe is 3.

The answer: 3.

He increased the value of the house by 80,000*1.5=<<80000*1.5=120000>>120,000
So the new value of the house is 120,000+80,000=$<<120000+80000=200000>>200,000
So he made a profit of 200,000-130,000=$<<200000-130000=70000>>70,000
#### 70000
[2024-12-31 14:25:25,457][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: To determine how much profit Josh made, we follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total investment:
   - Purchase price of the house: $80,000
   - Repairs: $50,000
   - Total investment = $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000

2. Calculate the value of the house after repairs:
   - The value increased by 150%. 
   - This means the value is now 150% more than the original purchase price of $80,000.
   - Increase in value = 150% of $80,000 = 1.5 * $80,000 = $120,000
   - New value of the house = Original price + Increase = $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000

3. Calculate profit:
   - Profit = Selling price (new value) - Total investment
   - Profit = $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000

Thus, Josh made a profit of $70,000. 

The answer: 70.

#### 540
[2024-12-31 14:25:28,370][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: To find out how many total meters James runs in a week, we need to calculate the total distance he runs in one day and then multiply that by the number of days he runs each week.

First, we find out the distance run in one day. James runs 3 sprints of 60 meters each. Therefore, the total distance for one day is:

3 sprints * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters.

Next, we need to calculate the total distance for the week. Since he runs 3 times a week, we multiply the daily distance by the number of days:

180 meters/day * 3 days/week = 540 meters/week.

So, James runs a total of 540 meters in a week.

The answer: 540.

[2024-12-31 14:25:31,576][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: If each chicken eats 3 cups of feed per day, then for 20 chickens they would need 3*20=<<3*20=60>>60 cups of feed per day.
If she feeds the flock 15 cups of feed in the morning, and 25 cups in the afternoon, then the final meal would require 60-15-25=<<60-15-25=20>>20 cups of chicken feed.
#### 20
[2024-12-31 14:25:31,577][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. First, we need to determine the total amount of feed Wendi needs for her flock of 20 chickens for the entire day. Each chicken receives 3 cups of feed per day. 

Total feed needed for 20 chickens in one day = 20 chickens * 3 cups/chicken = 60 cups.

2. Next, we already know that Wendi gives her chickens feed in two meals:
- In the morning, she gives them 15 cups of feed.
- In the afternoon, she gives them 25 cups of feed.

3. Now, we will sum the amount of feed she has already provided in these two meals:
Total feed given in the morning and afternoon = 15 cups + 25 cups = 40 cups.

4. Now, we can find out how much feed she still needs to give them for the final meal of the day:
Feed needed for the final meal = Total daily feed - Feed already given = 60 cups - 40 cups = 20 cups.

Therefore, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

The answer: 20.

[2024-12-31 14:25:35,183][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: The discount price of one glass is 60/100 * 5 = $<<60/100*5=3>>3.
If every second glass is cheaper, that means Kylar is going to buy 16 / 2 = <<16/2=8>>8 cheaper glasses.
So for the cheaper glasses, Kylar is going to pay 8 * 3 = $<<8*3=24>>24.
And for the regular-priced glasses, Kylar will pay 8 * 5 = $<<8*5=40>>40.
So in total Kylar needs to pay 24 + 40 = $<<24+40=64>>64 for the glasses he wants to buy.
#### 64
[2024-12-31 14:25:35,184][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: Let's break down the cost of the glasses Kylar wants to buy.

1. The price for the first glass is $5.
2. The price for the second glass is 60% of $5. To find this, we calculate:
   60% of $5 = 0.6 * 5 = $3.
   
3. Now, for every pair of glasses, the first one costs $5 and the second one costs $3. Therefore, for every two glasses, Kylar spends:
   $5 + $3 = $8.

4. Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, we can find out how many pairs of glasses that is:
   16 glasses ÷ 2 = 8 pairs.

5. Now we multiply the cost of one pair by the number of pairs:
   8 pairs * $8 = $64.

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses.

The answer: 64.

Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, which is 2 * 80 sheep = <<2*80=160>>160 sheep
Together, the three has 20 sheep + 160 sheep + 80 sheep = <<20+160+80=260>>260 sheep
#### 260
[2024-12-31 14:25:37,702][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: Let's denote the number of sheep in Seattle as S, Charleston as C, and Toulouse as T.

From the problem, we know:
1. Seattle (S) has 20 sheep.
2. Charleston (C) has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. Therefore, C = 4 * S = 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.
3. Toulouse (T) has twice as many sheep as Charleston. Therefore, T = 2 * C = 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Now, we can calculate the total number of sheep together:
Total sheep = S + C + T = 20 + 80 + 160 = 260.

The answer: 260.

Then divide that number by the download rate to find the time until Windows restarts: 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = <<80/2=40>>40 minutes
Then find the time to download the whole file after the restart: 200 GB / 2 GB/minute = <<200/2=100>>100 minutes
Then add the time to download 40% of the file, to download the whole file, and to wait for Windows to update: 40 minutes + 100 minutes + 20 minutes = <<40+100+20=160>>160 minutes
#### 160
[2024-12-31 14:25:44,019][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: Step 1: Calculate how much of the file Carla downloads before the restart.

Carla can download 2 GB per minute. If she is 40% of the way through a 200 GB file, she has downloaded:

200 GB * 40% = 80 GB.

Step 2: Calculate how long it takes to download the 80 GB.

To find out how long it takes to download 80 GB at a rate of 2 GB/minute, we use the formula:

Time = Amount of data / Download speed.

Time = 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes.

Step 3: Take into account the restart time.

After downloading 80 GB, Windows forces a 20-minute restart. 

Total time spent before restarting is:

40 minutes (downloading) + 20 minutes (restart) = 60 minutes.

Step 4: Restart the download for the remaining file.

After the restart, she has 200 GB - 80 GB = 120 GB left to download. 

Step 5: Calculate the time to download the remaining 120 GB.

Time = Amount of data / Download speed.

Time = 120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes.

Step 6: Calculate the total download time.

Total time = Time spent before restart + Time for the remaining download.

Total time = 60 minutes + 60 minutes = 120 minutes.

Therefore, the total time it takes to download the file is 120 minutes. 

The answer: 120.

[2024-12-31 14:25:52,881][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: Let's break down John's journey step by step:

1. **First Leg of the Trip**
   - John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles.
   - Therefore, after 3 hours, he is 180 miles away from home.

2. **Turnaround**
   - John turns around to go back home.

3. **Second Leg of the Trip**
   - John has 4 hours to get home but spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, meaning he has 2 hours left to drive.
   - During the next half hour, he drives at a speed of 30 mph.
     - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.
   - After half an hour at 30 mph, then he will have 1.5 hours left to drive.
   - He will start driving at 80 mph for the remaining 1.5 hours.
     - Distance = Speed × Time = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles.

4. **Total Distance Driven Back Home**
   - Total distance he covered when trying to return home = 15 miles (at 30 mph) + 120 miles (at 80 mph) = 135 miles.

5. **Calculating How Far He Is from Home**
   - Since he started his return 180 miles away from home, and he covered 135 miles back, we calculate:
   - Distance from home = Starting distance - Distance covered back = 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles.

At the end of the 4 hours, John is 45 miles away from home. 

The answer: 45.

[2024-12-31 14:26:02,106][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: Eliza is entitled to 45 -40 = <<45-40=5>>5 hours overtime pay.
Her hourly rate for the overtime pay is $10 x 1.2 = $<<10*1.2=12>>12.
So, Eliza will receive $12 x 5 =$<<12*5=60>>60 for overtime pay.
Her regular weekly earning is $10 x 40 = $<<10*40=400>>400.
Thus, Eliza will receive a total of $400 + $60 = $<<400+60=460>>460 for this week's work.
#### 460
[2024-12-31 14:26:02,106][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: First, let's determine Eliza's regular pay for the first 40 hours she worked. 

Her hourly rate for the first 40 hours is $10 per hour. Therefore, her earnings for these hours would be:

40 hours * $10/hour = $400

Next, we need to calculate her pay for the overtime hours. Overtime is paid at a rate of 1.2 times her regular hourly rate. 

Her overtime hourly rate is:

$10 * 1.2 = $12 per hour

Eliza worked a total of 45 hours, which means she worked 5 hours of overtime. 

Now, we can calculate her earnings from the overtime:

5 hours * $12/hour = $60

Now, we can find her total earnings for the week by adding her regular pay and her overtime pay:

$400 (regular pay) + $60 (overtime pay) = $460

Thus, Eliza's total earnings for this week is $460. 

The answer: 460.

In the first two months, the total number of downloads of the program was 180+60 = <<180+60=240>>240
In the third month, the number of downloads of the program reduced by 30/100*180 = <<30/100*180=54>>54
There were 180-54 = <<180-54=126>>126 downloads in the third month.
In the three months, the total number of downloads of the program was 126+240 = <<126+240=366>>366
#### 366
[2024-12-31 14:26:05,051][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Month Downloads**: The program had 60 downloads in the first month.

2. **Second Month Downloads**: The number of downloads in the second month is three times the downloads in the first month. So, 
   3 times 60 is:
   3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

3. **Third Month Downloads**: In the third month, the downloads were reduced by 30%. First, we need to find 30% of the second month's downloads:
   30% of 180 is:
   0.30 * 180 = 54 downloads.

   Therefore, the downloads in the third month would be:
   180 - 54 = 126 downloads.

4. **Total Downloads Over Three Months**: Now we can add the downloads from all three months together:
   60 (first month) + 180 (second month) + 126 (third month) = 366 downloads.

Therefore, the total number of downloads the program had over the three months is 366.

Therefore the total amount Toula paid for the pastries was $204 + $160 + $330 = $<<204+160+330=694>>694.
#### 694
[2024-12-31 14:26:08,715][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: To find the total cost of the pastries, we can calculate the cost for each type of pastry separately and then add them together.

1. Calculate the cost of the donuts:
   - Number of dozens: 3
   - Cost per dozen: $68
   - Total cost for donuts = 3 dozen * $68/dozen = 3 * 68 = $204

2. Calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes:
   - Number of dozens: 2
   - Cost per dozen: $80
   - Total cost for mini cupcakes = 2 dozen * $80/dozen = 2 * 80 = $160

3. Calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes:
   - Number of dozens: 6
   - Cost per dozen: $55
   - Total cost for mini cheesecakes = 6 dozen * $55/dozen = 6 * 55 = $330

Finally, add all the costs together:
Total cost = Cost of donuts + Cost of mini cupcakes + Cost of mini cheesecakes
Total cost = $204 + $160 + $330 = $694

The total cost that Toula spent at the bakery is $694.

The answer: 694.

#### 13
[2024-12-31 14:26:14,040][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we can set up the following calculations step by step:

1. **Cost to plant the tree**: Carlos has a one-time cost of $90 to plant the lemon tree.

2. **Annual income from lemons**: 
   - Every year, the tree produces 7 lemons.
   - Each lemon can be sold for $1.5.
   - Therefore, the total annual income from the lemons is:
     7 lemons/year * $1.5/lemon = $10.5/year.

3. **Annual expenses**: 
   - The annual cost to water and feed the tree is $3.

4. **Annual net income**: 
   - The net income per year can be calculated as follows:
     Annual income - Annual expenses = $10.5 - $3 = $7.5/year.

5. **Breaking even**: 
   - To find out how long it will take for Carlos to cover the initial $90 cost, we divide the total cost by the annual net income:
     $90 / $7.5/year = 12 years.

Thus, it will take Carlos 12 years to start earning money on the lemon tree.

   Then she sold 2 more at the red house, leaving her with:
   (2/3)x - 2 vacuum cleaners.
3. Now, she sold half of what was left at the orange house. At this point, the number of vacuum cleaners left before selling at the orange house is (2/3)x - 2. Half of this is:
   (1/2) * ((2/3)x - 2).
   So after selling at the orange house, she is left with:
   (2/3)x - 2 - (1/2) * ((2/3)x - 2).

Let's simplify this expression:
- First, we distribute (1/2) to (2/3)x - 2:
   (1/2) * (2/3)x - 1 = (1/3)x - 1.

Now we can substitute it back:
(2/3)x - 2 - ((1/3)x - 1).

This simplifies to:
(2/3)x - 2 - (1/3)x + 1
= ((2/3)x - (1/3)x) - 2 + 1
= (1/3)x - 1.

According to the problem, Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
(1/3)x - 1 = 5.

Now we solve this equation:
(1/3)x = 5 + 1
(1/3)x = 6
x = 6 * 3
x = 18.

So, Melanie initially started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

The answer: 18.

[2024-12-31 14:26:26,998][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: There are 20 x 20/100 = <<20*20/100=4>>4 students who enrolled in contemporary dance.
So, 20 - 4 = <<20-4=16>>16 students are enrolled in either jazz or hip-hop dance.
There are 16 x 25/100 = <<16*25/100=4>>4 students who enrolled in jazz dance.
Hence, 16 - 4 = <<16-4=12>>12 students enrolled in hip-hop dance.
This is 12/20 x 100% = 60% of the entire students.
#### 60
[2024-12-31 14:26:26,998][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. First, we find the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance. There are 20 students in total.
   - 20% of 20 students = 0.20 * 20 = 4 students.

2. Next, we calculate the number of students remaining after enrolling in contemporary dance.
   - Remaining students = Total students - Students in contemporary dance = 20 - 4 = 16 students.

3. Now, we find out how many of these remaining students enrolled in jazz dance.
   - 25% of the remaining 16 students = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students.

4. Finally, we calculate the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance.
   - Students in hip-hop dance = Remaining students - Students in jazz dance = 16 - 4 = 12 students.

5. To find the percentage of the entire class that enrolled in hip-hop dance, we use the number of students in hip-hop dance divided by the total number of students, multiplied by 100.
   - Percentage in hip-hop = (Students in hip-hop / Total students) * 100 = (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%.

Thus, the percentage of the entire students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is 60%.

The answer: 60.

If he purchases electronic gadgets, he will make a profit of 1.2% which is $8000*(1.2/100) = $<<8000*(1.2/100)=96>>96
If he wants to maximize profit, since $125 > $96, he will choose to purchase jewelry, thereby making a profit of $<<125=125>>125
#### 125
[2024-12-31 14:26:31,724][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: To determine which purchase plan would yield a higher profit for the merchant at the end of the month, we need to calculate the projected values of both the jewelry and the electronic gadgets after the respective market increases.

For the jewelry:
- Initial cost of jewelry: $5,000
- Expected increase: 2.5% (0.025)

The projected value after the increase would be:
Projected value of jewelry = Initial cost * (1 + Increase) 
= $5,000 * (1 + 0.025) 
= $5,000 * 1.025 
= $5,125

For the electronic gadgets:
- Initial cost of electronic gadgets: $8,000
- Expected increase: 1.2% (0.012)

The projected value after the increase would be:
Projected value of electronics = Initial cost * (1 + Increase) 
= $8,000 * (1 + 0.012) 
= $8,000 * 1.012 
= $8,096

Next, we can find the profit for each option. 

Profit from jewelry:
Profit from jewelry = Projected value of jewelry - Initial cost 
= $5,125 - $5,000 
= $125

Profit from electronic gadgets:
Profit from electronic gadgets = Projected value of electronics - Initial cost 
= $8,096 - $8,000 
= $96

Comparing the profits:
Profit from jewelry = $125 
Profit from electronic gadgets = $96 

Since $125 is greater than $96, the merchant should choose to invest in the jewelry.

The final profit from the chosen plan (jewelry) would be $125.

The answer: 125.

They also covered 150 miles/train * 2 trains = <<150*2=300>>300 miles together on the second day.
The combined distance the two trains covered in the two days is 300 miles + 160 miles = <<300+160=460>>460 miles
The average distance for the two days is 460 miles / 2 trains = <<460/2=230>>230 miles/train
#### 230
[2024-12-31 14:26:33,988][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: To find the total distance covered by each train in the two days, we need to calculate the distances covered on each day and then sum them.

On the first day, both trains travel westward:

- Distance covered westward = 80 miles

On the second day, they travel northward:

- Distance covered northward = 150 miles

Now, we will add the distances from both days:

Total distance covered = Distance westward + Distance northward
Total distance covered = 80 miles + 150 miles
Total distance covered = 230 miles

Therefore, the distance covered by each train in the two days is 230 miles.

The answer: 230.

Then find the total amount Jill makes per week coaching: $30/hour * 15 hours/week = $<<30*15=450>>450/week
Then add those two amounts to find the total amount Jill makes per week: $700/week + $450/week = $<<700+450=1150>>1150/week
Then multiply that number by the number of weeks Jill works in a year to find her annual salary: $1150/week * 50 weeks/year = $<<1150*50=57500>>57,500
#### 57500
[2024-12-31 14:26:38,689][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to determine her earnings from both her teaching and coaching jobs separately and then sum them up.

1. Calculate her earnings as a teacher:
   - Jill's hourly pay as a teacher is $20.
   - She works 35 hours a week.
   - So her weekly earnings as a teacher are 20 * 35 = $700.
   - She works for 50 weeks a year, so her annual earnings from teaching are 700 * 50 = $35,000.

2. Calculate her earnings as a cheerleading coach:
   - Jill's hourly pay as a coach is $30.
   - She works 15 hours a week as a coach.
   - So her weekly earnings as a coach are 30 * 15 = $450.
   - She also works for 50 weeks a year, so her annual earnings from coaching are 450 * 50 = $22,500.

3. Now, sum her annual earnings from both jobs:
   - Annual earnings from teaching: $35,000
   - Annual earnings from coaching: $22,500
   - Total annual salary = 35,000 + 22,500 = $57,500.

Therefore, Jill's annual salary is $57,500.

The answer: 57500.

After 4 weeks she will have eaten 4*21 = <<4*21=84>>84 eggs
There are 12 eggs in 1 dozen and she'll eat 84 eggs so that's 84/12 = <<84/12=7>>7 dozen eggs
#### 7
[2024-12-31 14:26:42,344][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: To find out how many dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we first determine how many eggs she consumes in a week.

1. Claire makes a 3 egg omelet every morning. 
2. There are 7 days in a week.

So, the number of eggs Claire eats in a week is:
3 eggs/morning * 7 mornings/week = 21 eggs/week.

Now, we find out how many eggs she eats in 4 weeks:
21 eggs/week * 4 weeks = 84 eggs in 4 weeks.

Next, we convert the total number of eggs into dozens. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by 12:
84 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 7 dozens of eggs.

Therefore, Claire will eat 7 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks. 

The answer: 7.

[2024-12-31 14:26:46,612][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: First figure out how many hours it takes to hike a 12-mile trail at 4 mph by dividing the distance by the speed: 12 miles / 4 mph = <<12/4=3>>3 hours
Next subtract the time Marissa already spent walking to find out how much time she has left: 3 hours - 1 hour - 1 hour = <<3-1-1=1>>1 hour
Now figure out how much distance she has left by subtracting the distance she already traveled from the total distance: 12 miles - 4 miles - 2 miles = <<12-4-2=6>>6 miles
Now divide the remaining distance by the remaining time to find out how fast in miles per hour Marissa has to travel: 6 miles / 1 hour = <<6/1=6>>6 mph
#### 6
[2024-12-31 14:26:46,613][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: To find out what speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance in order to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour over the entire 12-mile trail, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total time Marissa wants to take.** 
   The average speed is defined as total distance divided by total time. To maintain an average speed of 4 miles per hour over a 12-mile hike, the total time (T) she should take is:
   
   T = Total Distance / Average Speed = 12 miles / 4 miles per hour = 3 hours.

2. **Calculate the time she has already used.**
   Marissa has already walked the first 4 miles in 1 hour and the next 2 miles in another hour. So, the total time she has spent so far is:
   1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours.

3. **Determine the remaining time she has to complete the hike.**
   Since she wants to complete the hike in a total of 3 hours and has already spent 2 hours, the remaining time she has is:
   3 hours - 2 hours = 1 hour.

4. **Calculate the remaining distance she has to hike.**
   She has walked a total of 6 miles (4 miles + 2 miles), so the remaining distance is:
   12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles.

5. **Calculate the speed she needs to walk the remaining distance.**
   To find the required speed (S) to walk the remaining 6 miles in 1 hour, we use the formula:
   
   S = Distance / Time = 6 miles / 1 hour = 6 miles per hour.

Therefore, Marissa needs to walk at a speed of 6 miles per hour for the remaining distance to achieve her goal of an average speed of 4 miles per hour.

The answer: 6.

After 1 liter of orange drink was spilled, there were 10 - 1 = <<10-1=9>>9 liters of orange drink left.
Out of the 9 liters, 9 x 2/3 = <<9*2/3=6>>6 liters are water.
Thus, there are a total of 9 + 6 = <<9+6=15>>15 liters of water out of the 24 liters.
#### 15
[2024-12-31 14:26:55,073][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: First, let's determine the amount of water in the original 10 liters of orange drink and the 15 liters of pineapple drink.

1. **Orange Drink:**
   - The orange drink is two-thirds water, so:
     Water in orange drink = (2/3) * 10 liters = 20/3 liters ≈ 6.67 liters
   - Therefore, the amount of orange drink that is not water is:
     Total orange drink - Water = 10 liters - 20/3 liters = 10 liters - 6.67 liters = 3.33 liters

2. **Pineapple Drink:**
   - The pineapple drink is three-fifths water, so:
     Water in pineapple drink = (3/5) * 15 liters = 9 liters
   - The amount of pineapple drink that is not water is:
     Total pineapple drink - Water = 15 liters - 9 liters = 6 liters

Next, since you spilled 1 liter of the orange drink, we need to find out how much was left after the spill:

3. **Remaining Orange Drink after Spill:**
   - Originally, you had 10 liters, and spilling 1 liter leaves:
     Remaining orange drink = 10 liters - 1 liter = 9 liters

Since the composition remains the same, the water content in the remaining 9 liters of orange drink is still:
   - Water in remaining orange drink = (2/3) * 9 liters = 6 liters

4. **Total Volume After Mixing (Orange + Pineapple):**
   - You have 9 liters of the orange drink left and the full 15 liters of the pineapple drink, so:
     Total volume = 9 liters (orange) + 15 liters (pineapple) = 24 liters

5. **Total Water in the Final Mixture:**
   - Combine the amount of water in the remaining orange drink and the pineapple drink:
     Total water = Water from orange drink + Water from pineapple drink
     Total water = 6 liters (from orange) + 9 liters (from pineapple) = 15 liters

Therefore, the amount of water in the final 24 liters of drink is 15 liters.

The answer: 15.

#### 14
[2024-12-31 14:26:58,501][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: Let's break down the information:

1. Samantha is now 31 years old.
2. Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, that means Raymond is 31 + 6 = 37 years old.
3. Raymond had a son when he was 23 years old. 
4. To find out how old Raymond's son is now, we calculate how many years have passed since Raymond had his son: 
   - Raymond is currently 37 years old, and he was 23 when his son was born.
   - The age of Raymond's son now is 37 - 23 = 14 years old.

Now, to find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we simply look at his age:

Raymond's son is currently 14 years old, which means he was born 14 years ago.

The time from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM is 4 hours.

Since the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour, we can calculate the total melting by multiplying the rate of melting by the time:

Total melting = Rate of melting (2 cm/hour) x Time (4 hours) 
Total melting = 2 cm/hour * 4 hours = 8 centimeters

Thus, after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter.

Combining like terms, we get .75X = $19.50
Dividing both sides by .75, we get X = $26.
#### 26
[2024-12-31 14:27:05,824][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: To find the original price of the book, we need to set up the equation based on the information given. 

1. Let the original price be represented as P.
2. The book was sold at a 25% discount, which means Kyle paid 75% of the original price.
3. The amount Kyle paid is $19.50.

This can be expressed mathematically as:

0.75P = 19.50.

Next, to find P, we can rearrange the equation:

P = 19.50 / 0.75.

Now we perform the division:

P = 19.50 / 0.75 = 26.00.

Therefore, the original price of the book was $26.00.

Four apples cost $1.50 x 4 = $<<1.5*4=6>>6.
The total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples is $12 + $15 + $6 = $<<12+15+6=33>>33.
Thus, the boxes of pizza cost $50 - $33 = $<<50-33=17>>17.
Therefore, Marie ordered $17/$8.50 = <<17/8.5=2>>2 boxes of pizza.
#### 2
[2024-12-31 14:27:16,359][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: First, let's calculate the total cost of the items that Marie ordered besides the pizza.

1. The cost of the chicken meal is:
   1 x $12 = $12

2. The cost of the milk packs is:
   5 x $3 = $15

3. The cost of the apples is:
   4 x $1.50 = $6

Now, let's sum up these costs:
$12 (chicken meal) + $15 (milk) + $6 (apples) = $33

Now, we subtract this total from the amount Marie paid to find out how much was spent on pizza:
Total amount paid - Total cost of other items = Amount spent on pizza
$50 - $33 = $17

Next, we need to find out how many boxes of pizza Marie could buy with the remaining $17. Each box of pizza costs $8.50, so we divide the amount spent on pizza by the cost per box:
$17 ÷ $8.50 = 2 boxes (approximately 2.0)

Since Marie can't order a fraction of a box, we take the whole number which is 2.

Finally, let's conclude with the answer:
The answer: 2.

   Mishka bought 3 pairs of shoes at $42 each.
   Total cost for shoes = 3 * $42 = $126.

Now, we will add all the costs together:

Total cost = Total cost for shorts + Total cost for pants + Total cost for shoes
Total cost = $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243.

Therefore, Mishka spent a total of $243 on all the clothing items.

The answer: 243.

If each carton costs $4.00 and she needs 4 containers then it will cost her 4*4 = $<<4*4=16.00>>16.00
#### 16
[2024-12-31 14:27:22,697][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: First, we need to find out how many servings of ice cream Cynthia will eat in 60 days. Since Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, after 60 days, she will have eaten 60 servings.

Next, we need to determine how many cartons of ice cream she will need to buy. Each carton contains 15 servings. To find out how many cartons she needs, we divide the total servings by the number of servings per carton:

60 servings ÷ 15 servings per carton = 4 cartons.

Now we calculate the cost of the ice cream. Each carton costs $4.00. So, we multiply the number of cartons by the price per carton:

4 cartons × $4.00 per carton = $16.00.

Therefore, after 60 days, Cynthia will spend $16.00 on ice cream.

The answer: 16.

Henry traveled 60 miles - 35 miles = <<60-35=25>>25 miles between his first and second stop.
#### 25
[2024-12-31 14:27:26,469][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: To find out how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we can break it down step by step.

1. Henry's first stop was after 20 miles.
2. The total trip is 60 miles, so the distance remaining after the first stop is:
   60 miles - 20 miles = 40 miles.
3. Henry's second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. Since the total trip is 60 miles, the distance to the end of the trip after his first stop is:
   60 miles - 15 miles = 45 miles.
4. This means that he travels 45 miles after the first stop before reaching his second stop.
5. To find out how many miles he traveled between his first and second stops, subtract the distance of his first stop from the distance to his second stop:
   45 miles - 20 miles = 25 miles.

Therefore, Henry traveled 25 miles between his first and second stops.

The heels together cost 66 + 33 = $<<66+33=99>>99.
The boots cost $5 more than both pairs of heels together, so the boots cost 99 + 5 = $104.
#### 104
[2024-12-31 14:27:29,623][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: Let's denote the cost of the boots as B dollars.

Gloria has two pairs of high heels:
1. The first pair costs $33.
2. The second pair costs twice as much as the first, which means it costs 2 * $33 = $66.

Now, we can find the total cost of the two pairs of high heels:

Total cost of heels = $33 + $66 = $99.

According to the problem, the two pairs of high heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

B = Total cost of heels + 5
B = $99 + $5
B = $104.

So, the cost of the boots is $104.

The answer: 104.

Since the fraction of the ratio that represents Allen's age is 11/18, Allen's current age is 11/18*162 = <<11/18*162=99>>99
If Allen is currently 99 years old, in 10 years he will be 99+10 = <<99+10=109>>109 years old
#### 109
[2024-12-31 14:27:33,818][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: To find Darrell and Allen's ages, we can start by setting their ages according to the given ratio of 7:11. Let's denote Darrell's age as 7x and Allen's age as 11x.

According to the problem, their total age is 162. Therefore, we can write the equation:

7x + 11x = 162

Combining the terms, we have:

18x = 162

Next, we solve for x:

x = 162 / 18
x = 9

Now that we have the value of x, we can find Darrell's and Allen's current ages. 

Darrell's age is:

7x = 7 * 9 = 63

Allen's age is:

11x = 11 * 9 = 99

Now, to find Allen's age 10 years from now, we simply add 10 to his current age:

Allen's age in 10 years = 99 + 10 = 109

Thus, the answer is: 109.

#### 80
[2024-12-31 14:27:39,195][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: Let's break down the guesses made by each friend.

1. The first guess is 80.
2. The second guess is 20 more than half of the first guess. Half of 80 is 40, so 20 more than that is 40 + 20 = 60. Therefore, the second guess is 60.
3. The third guess is 25% more than the first guess. 25% of 80 is 20, so 25% more than 80 is 80 + 20 = 100. Therefore, the third guess is 100.

Now, we have the three guesses:
- First guess: 80
- Second guess: 60
- Third guess: 100

Next, we calculate the average of these guesses:
(80 + 60 + 100) / 3 = 240 / 3 = 80

The average guess is 80.

x+x+30=110
2*x=80
x=<<40=40>>40
Gretchen has 40+30=<<40+30=70>>70 gold coins
#### 70
[2024-12-31 14:27:45,305][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: Let's define the number of silver coins as S and the number of gold coins as G. 

We know from the problem that:
1. The total number of coins is 110, so S + G = 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, so G = S + 30.

Now we can substitute the second equation into the first equation. 

Substituting G in the total coins equation: 
S + (S + 30) = 110 

Combining like terms gives us:
2S + 30 = 110 

Now, subtract 30 from both sides:
2S = 110 - 30
2S = 80 

Now, divide both sides by 2:
S = 80 / 2
S = 40 

Now, we can find G using G = S + 30:
G = 40 + 30
G = 70 

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins. 

The answer: 70.

2. Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. We calculate half of Raymond's jewels first:
   Half of Raymond's jewels = R / 2 = 40 / 2 = 20.

3. Now we find out how many jewels Aaron has:
   Aaron's jewels = Half of Raymond's jewels + 5 = 20 + 5 = 25.

4. Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Therefore,
   Siobhan's jewels = Aaron's jewels - 2 = 25 - 2 = 23.

So, Siobhan has 23 jewels.

Next, we need to calculate how many points he scores in the second 20 minutes. He scores 25% more points than he did in the first 20 minutes. 

To find 25% of the 4 points scored in the first 20 minutes:
25% of 4 = 0.25 * 4 = 1 point.

Now, we add this 25% to the original score:
Points in the second 20 minutes = 4 + 1 = 5 points.

Finally, we calculate the total points scored by Mike:
Total points = Points in the first 20 minutes + Points in the second 20 minutes
Total points = 4 + 5 = 9 points.

60 yogurts / 4 yogurts per pack = 15 packs.

Now, we need to determine the cost of these 15 packs. Each pack costs $5.00, so we calculate:

15 packs * $5.00/pack = $75.00.

Thus, Terry spends a total of $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days.

#### 2
[2024-12-31 14:28:01,044][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Calculate the total money John earns from selling his lego sets**:
   John has 13 lego sets, selling each for $15. 

   Total earnings from selling lego sets = 13 lego sets * $15/lego set = $195.

2. **Calculate the total cost for the video games**:
   John buys 8 video games at $20 each.

   Total cost for video games = 8 video games * $20/video game = $160.

3. **Determine how much money he has after buying the video games**:
   From the total money earned ($195), he spends $160 on video games, leaving him with:

   Money left = Total earnings - Cost of video games
   Money left = $195 - $160 = $35.

4. **Considering the problem statement**:
   The problem states that he has $5 left after buying the video games. Therefore, the discrepancy indicates that all calculations regarding toys sold and video games purchased were appropriate, but we were just affirming his spending habits.

5. **Analyzing the information**:
   Since John sold all his lego sets (13) and bought video games with the money, he has 0 lego sets left now.

Thus, the total number of lego sets John still has is 0.

The answer: 0.

So for two days, he runs 3/2=<<3/2=1.5>>1.5 hours.
So in total, he runs 3+1.5+1.5=<<3+1.5+1.5=6>>6 hours.
So he runs 60/6=<<60/6=10>>10 mph.
#### 10
[2024-12-31 14:28:05,837][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: To find out how fast John runs, we first need to determine how many miles he runs each day.

1. John runs a total of 60 miles in a week and does so over 3 days.
2. Therefore, he runs 60 miles / 3 days = 20 miles per day.

Next, we will calculate the total time he runs over these three days:

- On the first day, he runs for 3 hours.
- On the other two days, he runs half as much, which is 3 hours / 2 = 1.5 hours each day.

So, the total time he runs over the three days is calculated as follows:

- First day: 3 hours
- Second day: 1.5 hours
- Third day: 1.5 hours

Total time = 3 hours + 1.5 hours + 1.5 hours = 6 hours.

Now we can find his speed:

Speed = Total distance / Total time 
Speed = 60 miles / 6 hours = 10 miles per hour.

Thus, John runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour.

The answer: 10.

[2024-12-31 14:28:19,940][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: If Dana can skip at half the speed she can run, then she can run at 3*2=<<3*2=6>>6 miles per hour.
And since she can run at a speed that is 4 times faster than she can walk, this means she can walk at 6/4=1.5 miles per hour.
If two-thirds of the time is spent walking, then she walks for 6*(2/3)=<<6*(2/3)=4>>4 hours.
If one-third of the time is spent running, then she runs for 6-4=<<6-4=2>>2 hours.
Thus, she runs for 2 hours at 6 miles per hour, or 2*6=<<2*6=12>>12 miles.
She walks for 4 hours at 1.5 miles per hour, or 4*1.5=<<4*1.5=6>>6 miles.
Thus, altogether, she travels 12+6=<<12+6=18>>18 miles.
#### 18
[2024-12-31 14:28:19,941][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: To solve this problem, we first need to determine Dana's walking and running speeds based on her skipping speed.

1. **Skipping speed**: We know that Dana skips at 3 miles per hour.
2. **Running speed**: Since her skipping speed is half as fast as her running speed, we can calculate her running speed as follows:
   - Running speed = Skipping speed * 2 = 3 miles per hour * 2 = 6 miles per hour.
3. **Walking speed**: We know that Dana can run at a speed that is four times faster than she can walk. Therefore, we can calculate her walking speed:
   - Running speed = Walking speed * 4 → Walking speed = Running speed / 4
   - Walking speed = 6 miles per hour / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.

Now, we know that:
- Walking speed = 1.5 miles per hour
- Running speed = 6 miles per hour
- Skipping speed = 3 miles per hour

Next, we need to find how far she can travel in six hours if she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking.

4. **Time spent running**: One-third of 6 hours is:
   - Time running = 6 hours * (1/3) = 2 hours.
5. **Time spent walking**: Two-thirds of 6 hours is:
   - Time walking = 6 hours * (2/3) = 4 hours.

Now we can calculate the distance she covers while running and walking.

6. **Distance running**:
   - Distance running = Speed running * Time running = 6 miles per hour * 2 hours = 12 miles.
7. **Distance walking**:
   - Distance walking = Speed walking * Time walking = 1.5 miles per hour * 4 hours = 6 miles.

Finally, we add the distances to find the total distance she can travel in six hours.

8. **Total distance**:
   - Total distance = Distance running + Distance walking = 12 miles + 6 miles = 18 miles.

Thus, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is 18 miles.

The answer: 18.

1200 feet is beyond the 1000-foot reach of the dragon's flames by a distance of 1200-1000=<<1200-1000=200>>200 feet.
#### 200
[2024-12-31 14:28:29,046][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: First, we start by determining how far Polly can throw the javelin without the sapphire gemstone, which is 400 feet. When she holds the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times that distance.

So, the distance Polly can throw the javelin while holding the gemstone is:
400 feet * 3 = 1200 feet.

Now, the dragon's flames reach a distance of 1000 feet. To find out how far outside of the reach of the dragon's flames Polly can stand and still hit the dragon, we subtract the dragon's reach from the distance Polly can throw the javelin while holding the gemstone:

1200 feet (Polly's throw with the gemstone) - 1000 feet (dragon's flame reach) = 200 feet.

[2024-12-31 14:28:31,779][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: To start the evening, there were 5 pies, each with 8 pieces, which is 5*8=<<5*8=40>>40 pieces of pie.
If only 14 remained, then 40-14=<<40-14=26>>26 pieces of pie had been taken by guests.
#### 26
[2024-12-31 14:28:31,779][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: First, we need to calculate the total number of pieces of pie that Grandma Jones baked. She made 5 apple pies and cut each pie into 8 pieces. 

Total pieces = Number of pies × Pieces per pie
Total pieces = 5 × 8 = 40 pieces

Next, we know that there were 14 pieces of pie remaining at the end of the evening. To find out how many pieces were taken by the guests, we subtract the remaining pieces from the total pieces.

Pieces taken = Total pieces - Remaining pieces
Pieces taken = 40 - 14 = 26 pieces

Therefore, the guests took 26 pieces of pie.

The answer: 26.

[2024-12-31 14:28:37,047][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: If the total calorie target is 2000 and I have consumed 1800 calories then I have 2000-1800 = <<2000-1800=200>>200 calories left to eat
If each serving of chips has 250 calories and I only have 200 calories left to eat, then I can only eat 200/250 of a serving = 4/5 of a serving
We also know that a 300g bag of chips has 5 servings, hence each serving has 300g/5 = <<300/5=60>>60 grams
If I can only eat 4/5 of a serving, then I can eat only 60g * 4/5 = 240g/5 = 48 grams
#### 48
[2024-12-31 14:28:37,047][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: First, we determine how many calories are in one serving of chips, which is provided as 250 calories. 

Next, we can calculate the total calories in the entire 300g bag of chips since it has 5 servings:
Total calories = 5 servings x 250 calories/serving = 1250 calories.

With a daily calorie target of 2000 calories and having already consumed 1800 calories, we find out how many calories are left for the day:
Remaining calories = 2000 calories - 1800 calories = 200 calories available.

Now, we need to find out how much of the chips we can eat while staying within this 200-calorie limit. Since one serving of chips has 250 calories, we first determine the fraction of a serving we can have:
Fraction of serving = Available calories / Calories per serving = 200 calories / 250 calories = 0.8 servings.

Next, we can calculate how many grams that represents. Since the bag contains 300 grams for 5 servings, we determine the weight of one serving:
Weight of one serving = 300 grams / 5 servings = 60 grams.

Now we find the weight corresponding to 0.8 servings:
Weight we can eat = 0.8 servings x 60 grams/serving = 48 grams.

Therefore, you can eat 48 grams of chips while keeping within your calorie limit.

The answer: 48.

He wants to sell each candle for $2.00 each and he's selling 20 candles so that's 2*20 = $<<2*20=40.00>>40.00
If he makes $40.00 selling candles and his supplies cost $20.00 then his net profit is 40-20 = $<<40-20=20.00>>20.00
#### 20
[2024-12-31 14:28:41,218][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: To find Charlie's net profit, we will follow these steps:

1. Determine how many pounds of beeswax Charlie needs to make 20 candles.
   Since he can make 10 candles per pound of beeswax, to make 20 candles, he would need:
   20 candles ÷ 10 candles per pound = 2 pounds of beeswax.

2. Calculate the total cost of supplies for the beeswax and wicks.
   Each pound of supplies costs $10.00, so for 2 pounds, the cost will be:
   2 pounds × $10.00 per pound = $20.00.

3. Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles.
   If he sells each candle for $2.00, then for 20 candles he makes:
   20 candles × $2.00 per candle = $40.00.

4. Calculate the net profit.
   Net profit is total revenue minus total costs. Therefore:
   $40.00 (total revenue) - $20.00 (total cost) = $20.00.

So, Charlie's net profit from making and selling 20 candles is $20.00.

The answer: 20.

[2024-12-31 14:28:45,318][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: If she wrote five articles on Monday, then on Tuesday she wrote 2/5* 5 = 2 more articles.
The total number of articles she wrote on Tuesday is 5+2 = <<5+2=7>>7
On Wednesday, the number of articles was twice the number she wrote on Tuesday, so it was 2*7 = <<2*7=14>>14 articles.
Over the three days, she wrote 5+7 +14 = <<5+7+14=26>>26 articles.
If each article takes her 4 hours to research and write about, she spent 4*26 = <<4*26=104>>104 hours on all the articles.
#### 104
[2024-12-31 14:28:45,319][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: First, let's find out how many articles Meredith wrote each day.

On Monday, she wrote 5 articles.

On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. 
To find the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday:
6/5 * 5 = 2 (the additional articles) 
So, on Tuesday she wrote:
5 + 2 = 7 articles.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles on Tuesday:
2 * 7 = 14 articles.

Now we can calculate the total number of articles written from Monday to Wednesday:
Monday: 5 articles
Tuesday: 7 articles
Wednesday: 14 articles

Now we sum them:
5 + 7 + 14 = 26 articles.

Next, we need to calculate the total time spent writing these articles. Since each article takes 4 hours to write:
Total hours = Total articles * Hours per article
Total hours = 26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours.

Therefore, the total number of hours she spent writing articles in the three days is 104 hours.

The answer: 104.

[2024-12-31 14:28:48,184][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: Let's let x be the number of post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased.
Then, the total number of post-it notes she had when she left the store was 80+x.
And if she used 220 Post-it notes at work and had 23 left, then 80+x=220+23
Subtracting 80 from each side of the equation, we see that x=220+23-80=<<220+23-80=163>>163 Post-it notes.
#### 163
[2024-12-31 14:28:48,184][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Candice started with 80 Post-it notes in her purse.
2. Let x be the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased.
3. At work, she used 220 Post-it notes, placing one on each of the 220 cups of coffee.
4. After using the Post-it notes, she had 23 remaining.

Now, we can set up the equation based on the information we have:

Initial Post-it notes + Post-it notes purchased - Post-it notes used = Remaining Post-it notes

This can be expressed as:
80 + x - 220 = 23

Now, we can solve for x:

1. Combine the constants:
80 - 220 + x = 23
-140 + x = 23

2. Add 140 to both sides:
x = 23 + 140
x = 163

So, the number of Post-it notes in the package that she purchased is 163.

The answer: 163.

So he bought 5 * 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 red ties
Each red tie cost $40 * .5 = $<<40*.5=20>>20 more than blue ties
So they each cost $40 + $20 = $<<40+20=60>>60
So he spent $60 * 10 = $<<60*10=600>>600 on red ties
So he spent $200 + $600 = $<<200+600=800>>800 on ties
#### 800
[2024-12-31 14:28:54,088][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. Determine the number of blue ties John bought:
   He spent $200 on blue ties, and each blue tie costs $40.
   Number of blue ties = Total spent on blue ties / Cost per blue tie
   Number of blue ties = $200 / $40 = 5 blue ties.

2. Determine the number of red ties John purchased:
   John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties.
   Number of red ties = 2 * Number of blue ties
   Number of red ties = 2 * 5 = 10 red ties.

3. Calculate the cost of blue ties:
   As already stated, John spent $200 on blue ties.

4. Determine the cost of red ties:
   The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties.
   Cost of one blue tie = $40.
   Cost of one red tie = Cost of one blue tie + 50% of Cost of one blue tie
   Cost of one red tie = $40 + 0.5 * $40 = $40 + $20 = $60.

5. Calculate the total cost of red ties:
   Total cost of red ties = Number of red ties * Cost per red tie
   Total cost of red ties = 10 * $60 = $600.

6. Calculate the total amount spent by John on ties:
   Total spent on ties = Total spent on blue ties + Total spent on red ties
   Total spent on ties = $200 + $600 = $800.

Therefore, John spent a total of $800 on ties.

The answer: 800.

#### 8
[2024-12-31 14:28:56,112][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: To find out how many pieces Tracy obtained, we first need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 4 feet to inches:

4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches.

Next, we know that Tracy cut the wire into pieces that are each 6 inches long. To find out how many 6-inch pieces can be obtained from 48 inches, we divide the total length of the wire in inches by the length of each piece:

48 inches ÷ 6 inches/piece = 8 pieces.

Thus, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire.

If 3/4 of the building is occupied, then the total number of occupied units is 3/4 * 120 units = <<3/4*120=90>>90 units.
The total number of unoccupied units is 120 units - 90 units = <<120-90=30>>30 units.
#### 30
[2024-12-31 14:28:58,262][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: To find the total number of unoccupied units in the building, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of units in the building.
   Since there are 15 floors and each floor has 8 units, we can multiply:
   Total units = Number of floors × Units per floor
   Total units = 15 × 8 = 120 units.

2. Determine how many units are occupied.
   We know that 3/4 of the building is occupied. So to find the number of occupied units, we calculate:
   Occupied units = (3/4) × Total units
   Occupied units = (3/4) × 120 = 90 units.

3. Calculate the number of unoccupied units.
   To find the unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total units:
   Unoccupied units = Total units - Occupied units
   Unoccupied units = 120 - 90 = 30 units.

Thus, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30.

There are 1764/12 = <<1764/12=147>>147 dozens of eggs produced in a week.
So, Lloyd makes 147 x $2 = $<<147*2=294>>294 on eggs.
#### 294
[2024-12-31 14:29:00,871][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: To find out how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we first need to determine how many eggs he sells per week and then calculate the revenue from those eggs.

1. Calculate the number of eggs produced in a week:
   - Lloyd produces 252 eggs per day.
   - There are 7 days in a week, so:
     252 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 1,764 eggs/week.

2. Convert the total number of eggs produced in a week into dozens:
   - There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so:
     1,764 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 147 dozens.

3. Calculate the revenue from selling those dozens:
   - Lloyd sells eggs for $2 per dozen, so:
     147 dozens * $2/dozen = $294.

Thus, Lloyd makes $294 on eggs per week.

#### 5
[2024-12-31 14:29:04,086][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: To solve this problem, we first need to determine the distance Tom travels from 1 PM to 4 PM. Since there are 3 hours between 1 PM and 4 PM, we can calculate the distance he travels in that time using the speed of 10 miles per hour.

Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour × 3 hours = 30 miles

So, Tom travels a distance of 30 miles to his destination.

Now, for the return journey, he is traveling back at a speed of 6 miles per hour. We need to find out how long it takes him to cover the same distance of 30 miles at this new speed.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 30 miles / 6 miles/hour = 5 hours

Thus, it takes Tom 5 hours to travel back to his original point.

#### 15
[2024-12-31 14:29:08,417][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: Let's start by calculating the total weight of the 30 comic books that Uriah plans to remove. Each comic book weighs 1/4 pound, so:

Weight of 30 comic books = 30 * (1/4) = 30/4 = 7.5 pounds.

Next, we find out how much more weight Uriah needs to remove after taking out the comic books. He needs to remove a total of 15 pounds, so:

Remaining weight to remove = 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.

Now, each toy weighs 1/2 pound. To find out how many toys he needs to remove to eliminate the remaining 7.5 pounds, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy:

Number of toys to remove = 7.5 / (1/2) = 7.5 * 2 = 15.

Therefore, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys.

On Friday the mechanic charged a total of 12*40 = $<<12*40=480>>480.
Thus, on Thursday, the day with higher revenue, the mechanic had 520-480 = $<<520-480=40>>40 more revenue than on Friday.
#### 40
[2024-12-31 14:29:15,404][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total revenue generated by the mechanic on both Thursday and Friday.

**Thursday:**
- The mechanic repairs 6 truck tires and 4 car tires.
- Revenue from truck tires: 6 truck tires * $60/truck tire = $360
- Revenue from car tires: 4 car tires * $40/car tire = $160
- Total revenue on Thursday = Revenue from truck tires + Revenue from car tires = $360 + $160 = $520

**Friday:**
- The mechanic repairs 12 car tires and does not repair any truck tires.
- Revenue from car tires: 12 car tires * $40/car tire = $480
- Total revenue on Friday = $480 (since there are no truck tires repaired).

Now we compare the revenues from both days:
- Thursday revenue = $520
- Friday revenue = $480

Next, we find out how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue (Thursday):

Difference in revenue = Thursday revenue - Friday revenue = $520 - $480 = $40.

Therefore, the mechanic earned $40 more on the day with higher revenue.

Combining the adopted kittens with those from the two cats, the Doubtfire family now has 7 + 33 = <<7+33=40>>40 kittens.
#### 40
[2024-12-31 14:29:23,736][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. The Doubtfire sisters already have 7 adopted kittens from the animal shelter.
   
2. Their mother informs them that Patchy, one of their two house cats, has had thrice the number of adopted kittens. Since they have 7 adopted kittens, we calculate the number of kittens Patchy has:
   - Patchy has 3 times 7 = 21 kittens.

3. The second cat, Trixie, has had 12 kittens.

4. Now, we add up all the kittens:
   - Kittens from the animal shelter: 7
   - Kittens from Patchy: 21
   - Kittens from Trixie: 12

5. So, total kittens = 7 + 21 + 12 = 40.

Thus, the Doubtfire family now has a total of 40 kittens.

30 - 2 = 28 lollipops.

Next, we need to determine how many bags Jean can fill with the remaining lollipops, where each bag contains 2 lollipops. 

To find the number of bags Jean can fill, we divide the remaining lollipops by the number of lollipops per bag:
28 lollipops ÷ 2 lollipops/bag = 14 bags.

[2024-12-31 14:29:30,341][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: To determine how many times Peter can go to the movies, we first need to calculate the total cost of one trip to the movies, which includes the ticket and the popcorn.

The cost of a ticket is $7 and the cost of popcorn is also $7. Therefore, the total cost for one trip (ticket + popcorn) is:

7 + 7 = 14 dollars.

Now, Peter has a total of 42 dollars for the week. To find out how many times he can go to the movies, we divide his total money by the total cost of one trip:

42 ÷ 14 = 3.

Thus, Peter can go to the movies 3 times with his 42 dollars.

The answer: 3.

[2024-12-31 14:29:39,121][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: The boxes can weigh up to 5000 pounds - 3755 pounds = <<5000-3755=1245>>1245 pounds in total.
There can be 1245 / 15 = <<1245/15=83>>83 boxes loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit.
#### 83
[2024-12-31 14:29:39,122][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the weight limit of the bridge, we start by determining the total weight limit and calculating the total weight of the truck and driver.

1. The weight limit of the bridge is 5000 pounds.
2. The weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds.
3. Let x be the number of boxes that can be added to the truck.
4. Each box weighs 15 pounds, so the total weight of the boxes is 15x pounds.

Now, we can set up an equation to express this situation:

Total weight on the bridge = weight of the truck and driver + weight of boxes

This can be written as:
3755 + 15x ≤ 5000

Now, we will solve for x:

First, subtract 3755 from both sides:
15x ≤ 5000 - 3755
15x ≤ 1245

Now, divide both sides by 15 to find x:
x ≤ 1245 / 15
x ≤ 83

Since the number of boxes must be a whole number, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck is 83.

The answer: 83.

His groceries were $40.00, there's a $10.00 fee plus another $7.00 in delivery/tip fees for a final total of $40 + $10 + $7 = $<<40+10+7=57.00>>57.00
#### 57
[2024-12-31 14:29:44,624][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: To find the final price of Stephen's groceries including all fees and tip, we can break it down step by step:

1. Start with the original grocery bill, which is $40.00.
2. Calculate the 25% fee added by the delivery vendor:
   25% of $40.00 = 0.25 * 40.00 = $10.00.
3. Add this fee to the original bill:
   $40.00 + $10.00 = $50.00.
4. Now, add the $3.00 delivery fee:
   $50.00 + $3.00 = $53.00.
5. Finally, add the tip of $4.00:
   $53.00 + $4.00 = $57.00.

So, the final price of Stephen's groceries after all extra fees and the tip is $57.00.

#### 187
[2024-12-31 14:29:46,694][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: First, we need to calculate the total number of fruit found in the clusters. Since there are 6 clusters and each cluster has 20 fruit, we can multiply these two numbers:

6 clusters * 20 fruit/cluster = 120 fruit in clusters.

Next, we add the number of individual fruit scattered across the bush. There are 67 individual fruit. 

Now we add the two totals together to find the total number of raspberries:

120 fruit (from clusters) + 67 fruit (individual) = 187 fruit total.

Therefore, the total number of raspberries is 187.

The total number of bad, unripe and sour oranges is therefore 1+5+2 = <<1+5+2=8>>8 oranges
The rest which is 25-8 = <<25-8=17>>17 oranges are good
#### 17
[2024-12-31 14:29:52,588][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: To solve the problem step by step, we start with the total number of oranges in the basket. 

1. Total number of oranges = 25
2. Bad oranges = 1
3. To find the number of unripe oranges, we calculate 20% of the total oranges: 
   Unripe oranges = 20% of 25 = 0.20 * 25 = 5
4. Sour oranges = 2

Now, we can find out how many oranges are not good. The oranges that are not good include the bad, unripe, and sour oranges:

- Bad oranges = 1
- Unripe oranges = 5
- Sour oranges = 2

Total not good = Bad + Unripe + Sour = 1 + 5 + 2 = 8

Now we can calculate the number of good oranges:

Good oranges = Total oranges - Not good oranges = 25 - 8 = 17

Therefore, the number of good oranges is 17.

The answer: 17.

Then multiply that number by the amount of her pension she gets per year: 10 years * 5% = 50%
Then multiply that percentage by the total amount of the full pension to find how much she gets: $50,000 * 50% = $<<50000*50*.01=25000>>25,000
#### 25000
[2024-12-31 14:29:58,672][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Marcy works for the company for 30 years in total.
2. After 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of her annual pension of $50,000.
3. The entitlement accrues after 20 years of service, which means for the next 10 years (from year 20 to year 30), she earns additional pension benefits.

Now, the calculation for the pension increment will be:
- At year 20, she is entitled to 5% of $50,000 which equals $2,500 per year.
- Since this entitlement lasts for the next 10 years, she receives this increment annually for those years.

To find her total annual pension after 30 years:
- The base pension is $50,000.
- The additional amount she accrues after 20 years is $2,500 annually for the 10 years she worked (from year 20 to year 30).

Thus, by the time she quits after 30 years, her annual pension will be:
- Total pension = Base pension + Accrued percentage
- Total pension = $50,000 + $2,500 = $52,500.

Therefore, Marcy's annual pension after 30 years will be $52,500.

The answer: 52500.

For the first six months, the streaming service charged her a total of 6*140 = $<<6*140=840>>840
For the next half of the year, the streaming service company charged her 10/100*140 = $<<10/100*140=14>>14 less
She paid $140-$14 = $<<140-14=126>>126 each month for the remaining half of the year,
In total, she paid 126*6 = $<<126*6=756>>756 for the other half of the year for the streaming service.
The total amount of money she paid at the end of the year is $840+$756 = $<<840+756=1596>>1596
#### 1596
[2024-12-31 14:30:03,901][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. **Calculate the amount paid for the first half of the year**: 
   Since the monthly fee is $140, for the first six months (half a year), Aleena will pay:
   140 * 6 = 840 dollars.

2. **Calculate the discounted monthly fee for the second half of the year**: 
   The second half of the year charges 10% less than the original fee. To find out the new monthly fee:
   10% of 140 = 0.10 * 140 = 14 dollars. 
   Therefore, the new fee for the second half of the year is:
   140 - 14 = 126 dollars.

3. **Calculate the amount paid for the second half of the year**: 
   For the next six months, Aleena pays 126 dollars each month. So for the second half of the year, she will pay:
   126 * 6 = 756 dollars.

4. **Calculate the total amount paid for the entire year**: 
   Now, we will add the amounts paid for both halves of the year:
   840 (first half) + 756 (second half) = 1596 dollars.

Thus, the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is 1596 dollars.

The answer: 1596.

[2024-12-31 14:30:10,503][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: To determine how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to first calculate her car's fuel efficiency in miles per gallon (mpg).

1. Sophia has traveled 100 miles and used 4 gallons of gas to fill up. Therefore, we can calculate her car's miles per gallon:
   Fuel Efficiency (mpg) = Distance Traveled / Gallons Used
   Fuel Efficiency (mpg) = 100 miles / 4 gallons = 25 miles per gallon.

2. Now, we know that her gas tank holds 12 gallons of gas. To find out how far she can drive on a full tank, we multiply her fuel efficiency by the total capacity of the tank:
   Distance on a Full Tank = Fuel Efficiency (mpg) * Tank Capacity (gallons)
   Distance on a Full Tank = 25 miles per gallon * 12 gallons = 300 miles.

Thus, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas.

The answer: 300.

2. He then reads for half as long, which is 2 hours / 2 = 1 hour.
3. So, the total time spent on TV and reading in one session is 2 hours (TV) + 1 hour (reading) = 3 hours.

Since he does this 3 times a week, we can calculate his total time for one week:

3 hours/session * 3 sessions/week = 9 hours/week.

Now, to find out how much time he spends in 4 weeks:

9 hours/week * 4 weeks = 36 hours.

Thus, Jim spends a total of 36 hours watching TV and reading in 4 weeks.

#### 48
[2024-12-31 14:30:17,154][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: To determine the total number of people sent by the schools to the basketball tournament, we can break this down into parts.

1. Each school has a girls' basketball team and a boys' basketball team. Since there are 4 schools, we first calculate the number of teams:
   - Girls’ teams: 4 schools * 1 team per school = 4 teams
   - Boys’ teams: 4 schools * 1 team per school = 4 teams
   - Total teams = 4 girls' teams + 4 boys' teams = 8 teams.

2. Each team has 5 players. Therefore, we can calculate the total number of players:
   - Total players = 8 teams * 5 players per team = 40 players.

3. Each team also has a coach. Since there are 8 teams (4 boys' + 4 girls'), this means:
   - Total coaches = 8 teams * 1 coach per team = 8 coaches.

4. Finally, we add the total number of players to the total number of coaches:
   - Total people sent = 40 players + 8 coaches = 48 people.

Therefore, the total number of people sent to the tournament is 48.

The answer: 48.

So, the total number of gems in the treasure chest is 175 + 140 + 280 = <<175+140+280=595>>595.
#### 595
[2024-12-31 14:30:20,887][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The number of diamonds is given as 175.

2. The number of rubies is 35 fewer than the number of diamonds. Therefore, we calculate the number of rubies as:
   Rubies = Diamonds - 35
           = 175 - 35
           = 140.

3. The number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies. Therefore, we calculate the number of emeralds as:
   Emeralds = 2 * Rubies
            = 2 * 140
            = 280.

4. Now, we need to find the total number of gems in the chest. To do this, we add together the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds:
   Total gems = Diamonds + Rubies + Emeralds
              = 175 + 140 + 280
              = 595.

So, the total number of gems in the chest is 595.

#### 36
[2024-12-31 14:30:24,892][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: To solve the problem, we first need to determine how many boys there are at Dr. Wertz's school. We know that there are twice as many boys as girls. 

Since there are 60 girls, we can calculate the number of boys as follows:
Number of boys = 2 * Number of girls = 2 * 60 = 120 boys.

Next, we can find the total number of students in the school by adding the number of boys and girls together:
Total number of students = Number of boys + Number of girls = 120 + 60 = 180 students.

Now, we know that there are 5 students for every teacher. To find the number of teachers, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per teacher:
Number of teachers = Total number of students / Students per teacher = 180 / 5 = 36 teachers.

Hence, the final answer is: The answer: 36.

#### 60
[2024-12-31 14:30:28,829][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: To solve the problem, we need to find out how much money Bailey started with.

1. Calculate the total amount Bailey receives from her weekly allowance over 8 weeks. 
   If she receives $5 each week for 8 weeks, we can calculate the total allowance as follows:
   Total allowance = Weekly allowance * Number of weeks
   Total allowance = $5 * 8 = $40

2. We know that at the end of the 8 weeks, Bailey has a total of $100. This total includes the amount she started with plus the allowance she received.
   Let's denote the amount Bailey started with as "x". 

3. The equation for the total amount at the end of the 8 weeks will be:
   x + Total allowance = Total amount at the end of 8 weeks
   x + $40 = $100

4. To find x, we can rearrange the equation:
   x = Total amount at the end of 8 weeks - Total allowance
   x = $100 - $40
   x = $60

So, Bailey started with $60. 

The answer: 60.

[2024-12-31 14:30:37,647][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: To find out how many instructions Kelian has to read to prepare both dishes, we need to calculate the number of instructions in each recipe and then sum them up.

1. The first recipe has 20 instructions.
2. The second recipe has twice as many instructions as the first one, which is 2 * 20 = 40 instructions.

Now, we add the number of instructions from both recipes:
20 (from the first recipe) + 40 (from the second recipe) = 60 instructions.

Therefore, Kelian has to read a total of 60 instructions to prepare the two dishes.

The answer: 60.

Tommy raised 23 slices x $4 = $<<23*4=92>>92 by selling cheesecakes.
In total Tommy has raised $129 + $92 = $<<129+92=221>>221
#### 221
[2024-12-31 14:30:41,176][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: To find out how much money Tommy raises by selling brownies and cheesecakes, we need to calculate the total earnings from each type of dessert and then sum them.

1. Calculate the earnings from brownies:
   - Tommy sells 43 brownies at $3 each.
   - Total from brownies = 43 brownies * $3/brownie = $129.

2. Calculate the earnings from cheesecakes:
   - Tommy sells 23 slices of cheesecake at $4 each.
   - Total from cheesecakes = 23 cheesecakes * $4/cheesecake = $92.

3. Now add the two totals together to find the overall amount raised:
   - Total raised = Total from brownies + Total from cheesecakes = $129 + $92 = $221.

Therefore, Tommy raises a total of $221.

The answer: 221.

[2024-12-31 14:30:46,092][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: A $150 x 2/100 = $<<150*2/100=3>>3 interest will be charged for each unit.
So, each cell phone costs $150 + $3 = $<<150+3=153>>153.
The total amount to be paid for 5 cell phones is $153 x 5 = $<<153*5=765>>765.
Thus, Shiela will pay $765/3 = $<<765/3=255>>255 each month.
#### 255
[2024-12-31 14:30:46,092][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: First, let's calculate the total cost of the five cell phones that Shiela bought. 

The cost of one cell phone is $150, and she bought five:

Cost of five cell phones = 5 * $150 = $750.

Next, we need to calculate the interest charged for each cell phone. The interest rate is 2%, so we multiply the cost of one cell phone by the interest rate:

Interest per cell phone = $150 * 0.02 = $3.

Since Shiela bought five cell phones, we need to calculate the total interest for all five:

Total interest = 5 * $3 = $15.

Now, we add the total interest to the total cost of the five cell phones to get the overall amount that Shiela will pay:

Total amount to be paid = Total cost of cell phones + Total interest
Total amount to be paid = $750 + $15 = $765.

Finally, we will divide this total amount by the number of months (3) to find out how much Shiela will pay each month:

Monthly payment = Total amount to be paid / Number of months
Monthly payment = $765 / 3 = $255.

Therefore, Shiela will pay $255 each month for 3 months. 

The answer: 255.

Altogether, Artie will make $36 + $18 + $34 = $<<36+18+34=88>>88
#### 88
[2024-12-31 14:30:48,970][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: To solve this problem step by step, we need to first round the prices of each type of flower to the nearest dollar.

1. **Rounding the prices:**
   - Marigolds: $2.74 rounds to $3.00
   - Petunias: $1.87 rounds to $2.00
   - Begonias: $2.12 rounds to $2.00

2. **Calculating the total revenue:**
   - For marigolds: 12 pots * $3.00 = $36.00
   - For petunias: 9 pots * $2.00 = $18.00
   - For begonias: 17 pots * $2.00 = $34.00

3. **Adding the total amounts:**
   - Total revenue = $36.00 + $18.00 + $34.00
   - Total revenue = $88.00

Therefore, Artie will make $88. The answer: 88.

The four levels total to 240 square feet because 128 + 64 + 32 + 16 = <<128+64+32+16=240>>240
The average square footage of a level is 60 because 240 / 4 = <<240/4=60>>60
#### 60
[2024-12-31 14:30:52,733][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: To find the average square footage of the levels of the sandcastle, we first need to calculate the square footage of each level.

1. The top level (Level 1) has a square footage of 16.
2. Level 2 will have half the square footage of Level 1: 
   Level 2 = 16 / 2 = 8.
3. Level 3 will have half the square footage of Level 2: 
   Level 3 = 8 / 2 = 4.
4. Level 4 will have half the square footage of Level 3: 
   Level 4 = 4 / 2 = 2.

Now we have the square footage for all four levels:
- Level 1: 16
- Level 2: 8
- Level 3: 4
- Level 4: 2

Next, we calculate the total square footage of all levels combined:
Total square footage = 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30.

To find the average square footage, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels:
Average square footage = Total square footage / Number of levels = 30 / 4 = 7.5.

Therefore, the average square footage of a level is 7.5.

The answer: 7.5.

The number of cups of dog food given for the rest of the first year is 185 * 2 = <<185*2=370>>370 cups
The total number of cups given in the first year is 180 + 370 = <<180+370=550>>550 cups
The number of bags of dog food used in the first year is 550 / 110 = <<550/110=5>>5 bags
#### 5
[2024-12-31 14:30:58,396][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: To calculate the total amount of dog food Cecilia will need in the first year, we will break it down into two parts: the first 180 days and the next days within the year.

1. For the first 180 days, Cecilia feeds her puppy 1 cup of dog food each day:
   - Total food for the first 180 days = 1 cup/day * 180 days = 180 cups.

2. For the remainder of the year, which is 365 days - 180 days = 185 days, she feeds the puppy 2 cups of dog food each day:
   - Total food for the next 185 days = 2 cups/day * 185 days = 370 cups.

3. Adding both amounts together gives:
   - Total food in the first year = 180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups.

Next, we need to figure out how many bags of dog food this will require. Since each bag contains 110 cups, we calculate the number of bags needed:
   - Number of bags = Total cups / Cups per bag = 550 cups / 110 cups/bag = 5 bags.

Thus, Cecilia will use 5 bags of dog food in the first year.

The answer: 5.

Sara also does 4 times as much laundry as David, meaning David does 400/4 = <<400/4=100>>100 pounds of laundry.
The difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is 200-100 = <<200-100=100>>100 pounds
#### 100
[2024-12-31 14:31:03,906][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: To solve the problem step by step, let's first establish the relationships based on the information provided.

1. Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.
2. According to the problem, Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David. Therefore, we can calculate David's laundry as follows: 
   David's laundry = Sarah's laundry / 4 = 400 pounds / 4 = 100 pounds.

3. Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. Thus, we can calculate Raymond's laundry as:
   Raymond's laundry = Sarah's laundry / 2 = 400 pounds / 2 = 200 pounds.

Now that we have the amounts of laundry done by each individual:
- Raymond does 200 pounds.
- David does 100 pounds.

Finally, we can calculate the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do:
Difference = Raymond's laundry - David's laundry = 200 pounds - 100 pounds = 100 pounds.

The answer: 100.

#### 6
[2024-12-31 14:31:10,517][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: Let's calculate the cost for each option for 18 flowers.

**Option 1:** Buying in packages of 3 for $2.50.
- Each package contains 3 flowers.
- To find out how many packages are needed for 18 flowers, we divide 18 by 3:
  18 flowers / 3 flowers/package = 6 packages.
- The cost for 6 packages is:
  6 packages * $2.50/package = $15.00.

**Option 2:** Buying in packages of 2 for $1.
- Each package contains 2 flowers.
- To find out how many packages are needed for 18 flowers, we divide 18 by 2:
  18 flowers / 2 flowers/package = 9 packages.
- The cost for 9 packages is:
  9 packages * $1/package = $9.00.

Now, let's find out how much money Vincent saves by choosing the better price:
- Cost when buying in packages of 3: $15.00.
- Cost when buying in packages of 2: $9.00.
  
Savings when buying the cheaper option:
$15.00 - $9.00 = $6.00.

Thus, the amount of money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price is $6.00.

The answer: 6.

To find the discount amount, we calculate:
30% of $100 = 0.30 * 100 = $30.

Now, we subtract the discount from the original cost to find the final grooming cost:
$100 - $30 = $70.

Therefore, the grooming cost after applying the discount is $70.

So the two girls got a total of 4 x 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 liters.
Thus, a total of 8 + 6 = <<8+6=14>>14 liters of water were gotten by the two girls and the boy.
Therefore, 24 - 14 = <<24-14=10>>10 liters of water were left.
#### 10
[2024-12-31 14:31:16,270][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: First, let's calculate how much water each girl received. Each girl got 1/6 of the 24 liters of water. 

To find out how much that is:

1/6 * 24 liters = 4 liters.

Since there are two girls, together they received:

4 liters + 4 liters = 8 liters.

Next, the boy received 6 liters of water.

Now, let's add the amounts of water received by the two girls and the boy:

8 liters (from the girls) + 6 liters (from the boy) = 14 liters.

Now, we subtract this total from the initial amount of water, which was 24 liters:

24 liters - 14 liters = 10 liters.

Therefore, the amount of water left is 10 liters.

Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times Grace's weight:

1. Calculate 4 times Grace's weight:
   4 x 125 = 500 pounds

2. Now subtract 2 pounds from this amount to find Alex's weight:
   500 - 2 = 498 pounds

Now, we calculate their combined weights:

3. Add Grace's weight and Alex's weight together:
   125 + 498 = 623 pounds

Therefore, the combined weight of Grace and Alex is 623 pounds.

   - Total roses = 3 bushes * 25 roses/bush = 75 roses.

2. Next, calculate the total number of thorns by multiplying the number of roses by the number of thorns per rose:
   - Each rose has 8 thorns.
   - Total thorns = 75 roses * 8 thorns/rose = 600 thorns.

Therefore, the total number of thorns is 600.

The number of wins is L + <<+8=8>>8.
The team played (L+8) + L = 2L + 8 = 22 games.
So, 2L = 22 - 8 = 14
So L = 14/2 = <<14/2=7>>7 losses.
Therefore, the team won 22 – 7 = <<22-7=15>>15 games.
#### 15
[2024-12-31 14:31:28,163][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: Let's denote the number of games the team lost as L and the number of games they won as W. 

We are given two pieces of information:
1. The total number of games played: W + L = 22
2. They won 8 more games than they lost: W = L + 8

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first. 

Substituting W in the first equation gives us:

(L + 8) + L = 22

Now we can combine like terms:

2L + 8 = 22

Next, we subtract 8 from both sides:

2L = 14

Now we divide both sides by 2 to find L:

L = 7

Now that we have the number of games lost, we can find the number of games won using the equation W = L + 8:

W = 7 + 8 = 15

The team won 15 games. 

The answer: 15.

He goes on 4 vacations a year, so he has been on 4 * 11 = <<4*11=44>>44 vacations.
Gene has 1 shirt from each vacation, so he has 44 * 1 = <<44*1=44>>44 quilt blocks in all.
#### 44
[2024-12-31 14:31:31,195][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: To find out how many quilt blocks Gene has, we start by calculating the number of years he has been vacationing. 

1. Gene is currently 34 years old and he has been vacationing since he was 23 years old.
2. The number of years he has been vacationing is: 
   34 - 23 = 11 years.

Now, since he goes on four vacations each year, we calculate the total number of vacation shirts:

3. Total number of vacation shirts = Number of years * Number of vacations per year
4. Total number of vacation shirts = 11 years * 4 vacations/year = 44 vacation shirts.

[2024-12-31 14:31:34,006][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: The second time Greg’s alarm went off, it rang three times as long as the first, so it rang 3 * 4 = <<3*4=12>>12 times the second time.
The third time it went off, it rang half as long as the second, so it rang 12 / 2 = <<12/2=6>>6 times the third time.
In all, Greg’s alarm rang 4 + 12 + 6 = <<4+12+6=22>>22 times.
#### 22
[2024-12-31 14:31:34,007][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The first time the alarm rang, it rang 4 times.
2. The second time, it rang for three times as long as the first time. Since we know the first time had 4 rings, the second time had:
   4 rings * 3 = 12 rings.
3. The third time, it rang for half as long as the second time. Therefore, the third time had:
   12 rings / 2 = 6 rings.

Now, we can count the total number of times the alarm rang throughout the day:
Total = First time + Second time + Third time
Total = 4 + 12 + 6 = 22.

So, the alarm rang a total of 22 times.

The answer: 22.

[2024-12-31 14:31:39,830][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: In a month, Sylvie earns $600. which totals $600/month * 12 months/year = $7200 in a year.
Sylvie earnings will increase by 10/100 * $7200/year = $<<10/100*7200=720>>720/year after 5 years.
In three years, the total increase in her salary will be 3 years * $720/year = $<<3*720=2160>>2160
After three years, Sylvie will be paid $7200 + $2160 = $<<7200+2160=9360>>9360
#### 9360
[2024-12-31 14:31:39,831][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: To determine Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we can follow these steps:

1. **Initial Salary**: Sylvie's initial monthly salary is $600. Therefore, her annual salary is calculated as:
   Annual Salary = Monthly Salary * 12
   Annual Salary = $600 * 12 = $7,200.

2. **Salary Increase**: Since Sylvie has worked for the company for over five years, she is eligible for a salary increase. The company increases salaries by 10% of the initial salary every year after five years.

   Increase = 10% of Initial Salary
   Increase = 0.10 * $7,200 = $720.

3. **Total Increase Over Three Years**: Since the increase happens once a year, we need to calculate the increase for each of the three years. Thus, the total increase over three years is:
   Total Increase = Increase * 3
   Total Increase = $720 * 3 = $2,160.

4. **New Annual Salary**: To find Sylvie's new annual salary after three years, we add the total increase to her initial salary:
   New Annual Salary = Initial Annual Salary + Total Increase
   New Annual Salary = $7,200 + $2,160 = $9,360.

Therefore, after three more years of service, Sylvie's annual salary will be $9,360.

The answer: 9360.

[2024-12-31 14:31:43,146][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: Let m be the number of copies Marilyn sold and h be the number Harald sold. We know that m + h = 80,000 and m = 10h.
Substituting the second equation into the first, we get 10h + h = 88,000
Combining like terms, we get 11h = 88,000
Dividing both sides by 11, we get h = 8,000
#### 8000
[2024-12-31 14:31:43,147][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: Let's denote the number of copies sold by Harald as x. According to the problem, Marilyn sold 10 times as many copies as Harald, which can be expressed as 10x.

The total copies sold by both of them is given as 88,000. We can set up the following equation:

x (Harald's sales) + 10x (Marilyn's sales) = 88,000

This simplifies to:

11x = 88,000

Now, to find x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 11:

x = 88,000 / 11
x = 8,000

Thus, Harald sold 8,000 copies. 

The answer: 8000.

[2024-12-31 14:31:45,698][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: First, let's determine how many guests are expected to show up. Since 1/4 of the invited guests don't show up, this means that 3/4 of the guests will attend.

The number of guests that Christina invited is 16. To find out how many are expected to show up, we calculate:

Expected attendees = 16 * (3/4) = 12

Next, we need to calculate how many gift bags she will need. Since she needs 0.75 gift bags per guest, we calculate the total gift bags required:

Total gift bags = 12 * 0.75 = 9

Now, each gift bag costs $2. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of gift bags by the price per gift bag:

Total cost = 9 * $2 = $18

Thus, Christina will spend $18 on gift bags for her party.

The answer: 18.

To feed 5 dinosaur children, he will need 5*5=<<5*5=25>>25 pounds of potato salad.
In total, he will need to bring 200+25=<<200+25=225>>225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic.
#### 225
[2024-12-31 14:31:50,232][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: First, we need to determine how much potato salad the adults will consume. Since each adult eats 10 lbs of potato salad, we can calculate the total for the 20 adults:

20 adults * 10 lbs/adult = 200 lbs of potato salad for adults.

Next, we need to find out how much potato salad the children will eat. Since each child eats half of what an adult eats, that would be:

10 lbs/adult * 0.5 = 5 lbs/child.

Now, we can calculate the total for the 5 children:

5 children * 5 lbs/child = 25 lbs of potato salad for children.

Now, we add the total potato salad needed for adults and children:

200 lbs (adults) + 25 lbs (children) = 225 lbs of potato salad.

Therefore, Ted needs to bring 225 lbs of potato salad to ensure there’s enough for everyone at the picnic.

1. We know that James is 10 years old.
2. James is 1 year younger than Corey. Therefore, Corey must be:
   Corey = James + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11 years old.
3. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey. So, we can calculate Amy's age as follows:
   Amy = Corey - 2 = 11 - 2 = 9 years old.
4. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson. Hence, we can find Jackson's age like this:
   Jackson = Amy - 5 = 9 - 5 = 4 years old.

Therefore, Jackson is 4 years old.

10% of 40 seconds is 40*0.1=<<40*0.1=4>>4 seconds.
The improved diet reduced Gerald's race time to 40-4=<<40-4=36>>36 seconds.
#### 36
[2024-12-31 14:31:58,760][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: Let's start by determining the time Gerald would run the 400-meter hurdles without any improvements.

According to the problem, Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, and he is 2 seconds faster than Gerald. Therefore, we can find Gerald's time as follows:

Gerald's time = Lee's time + 2 seconds
Gerald's time = 38 seconds + 2 seconds
Gerald's time = 40 seconds

Now, we know that Gerald improved his speed by 10% after changing his diet. To find out how much time he can now run the 400-meter hurdles, we first determine what 10% of his original time (40 seconds) is:

10% of 40 seconds = 0.10 * 40 seconds = 4 seconds

This means that Gerald can reduce his time by 4 seconds. Now we subtract this reduction from his original time:

New time for Gerald = Original time - Reduction
New time for Gerald = 40 seconds - 4 seconds
New time for Gerald = 36 seconds

Therefore, after his dietary improvements, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds.

The answer: 36.

[2024-12-31 14:32:04,515][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: If there are two cats for every dog, and the number of dogs is 60, the number of cats is 2*60 = <<2*60=120>>120
The combined number of cats and dogs is 120+60 = <<120+60=180>>180
The number of rabbits pets is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats, a total of 180-12 = 168
The total number of pets in the compound is 168+180 = <<168+180=348>>348
#### 348
[2024-12-31 14:32:04,515][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: Let's denote the number of dogs as D, the number of cats as C, and the number of rabbits as R.

We know from the problem statement:

1. The number of dogs (D) is 60.
2. There are two cats for every dog, which means C = 2D. Since D = 60, we can substitute this into the equation:
   C = 2 * 60 = 120.

Now we have:
- D = 60
- C = 120

Next, we know that the number of rabbits (R) is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats:
R = (D + C) - 12.

Substituting the values of D and C into this equation:
R = (60 + 120) - 12
R = 180 - 12
R = 168.

Now we can find the total number of pets in the neighborhood by adding the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:
Total pets = D + C + R
Total pets = 60 + 120 + 168
Total pets = 348.

The answer: 348.

Therefore, 120 - 80 = <<120-80=40>>40 girls are not in the girl scout.
#### 40
[2024-12-31 14:32:09,970][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: To solve this problem step by step, we first need to find out how many boys and girls there are among the 200 Grade 5 students.

1. Calculate the number of boys:
   The number of boys is given by 2/5 of the total number of students.
   Boys = (2/5) * 200 = 80 boys.

2. Calculate the number of girls:
   The total number of students is 200, so the number of girls is:
   Girls = Total students - Boys = 200 - 80 = 120 girls.

3. Calculate how many girls are in the girl scout:
   We know that 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout.
   Girl scouts = (2/3) * 120 = 80 girls in the girl scout.

4. Calculate how many girls are not in the girl scout:
   Girls not in the girl scout = Total girls - Girls in the girl scout = 120 - 80 = 40 girls.

Thus, the number of girls not in the girl scout is 40.

James's sleep = (2/3) * 9 hours 

Now, calculating this:

James's sleep = 6 hours.

Next, we find out how many more hours Harry slept than James:

Difference = Harry's sleep - James's sleep
Difference = 9 hours - 6 hours = 3 hours.

Therefore, Harry slept 3 more hours than James.

#### 12
[2024-12-31 14:32:16,288][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, let's first determine how much volume of canned tomatoes she started with to produce the 32 ounces of sauce.

1. Since the tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked, to produce 32 ounces of sauce, Freda must have started with 32 ounces * 2 = 64 ounces of canned tomatoes.

2. Each 16-ounce can of tomatoes contains 3 tomatoes. Now, we need to find out how many cans of tomatoes were used to obtain 64 ounces.

3. To calculate the number of cans, we divide the total volume of the canned tomatoes (64 ounces) by the volume per can (16 ounces):
   64 ounces / 16 ounces per can = 4 cans.

4. Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, we can find the total number of tomatoes used by multiplying the number of cans by the number of tomatoes per can:
   4 cans * 3 tomatoes per can = 12 tomatoes.

Therefore, Freda used 12 tomatoes.

Most of the cars exited in the final 15 minutes so in the first 15 minutes, there must have been 25 total cars – 20 cars that drove through in the final 15 minutes = 5 cars that drove through the traffic jam.
#### 5
[2024-12-31 14:32:22,253][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: Let's break down the details of the problem step by step. 

1. There are originally 30 cars on the motorway.
2. After the first 15 minutes, an unspecified number of cars drive through the traffic jam.
3. Then, in the next 15 minutes, 20 more cars drive through.
4. During the traffic jam, 5 cars take an exit and do not drive through the traffic jam.

To find out how many cars drove through in the first 15 minutes, we have to account for the total number of cars at the end:

- Start with 30 cars.
- Since 5 cars took an exit, the number of cars remaining in the traffic jam is 30 - 5 = 25 cars.
- After 15 minutes, some number of cars (let's call this X) drove through, making the count of remaining cars 25 - X.
- In the next 15 minutes, 20 more cars drove through, leaving a total of (25 - X) - 20 = 5 - X remaining.

At this point, we have:

Remaining cars after 30 minutes = 5 - X.

Given that there are no specified cars left after 30 minutes, assuming they all either drove through or took an exit, this means:

5 - X = 0.

Solving for X gives us:

X = 5.

So, in the first 15 minutes, 5 cars drove through the traffic jam.

Putting everything together, we find that the answer is: The answer: 5.
