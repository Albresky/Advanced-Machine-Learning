[2024-12-31 16:48:07,205][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: Janet sells 16 - 3 - 4 = <<16-3-4=9>>9 duck eggs a day.
She makes 9 * 2 = $<<9*2=18>>18 every day at the farmer’s market.
#### 18
[2024-12-31 16:48:07,205][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: First, we need to determine how many eggs Janet eats each day. If she eats three for breakfast and bakes four for her friends, that means she eats a total of 3 + 4 = <<3+4=7>>7 eggs each day.
Since Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day, the number of eggs she has left over is 16 - 7 = <<16-7=9>>9 eggs.
Since she sells the remaining eggs at the farmers' market for $2 each, she makes 9 eggs \* $2/egg = $<<9\*2=18>>18 per day at the farmers' market. Answer: \boxed{18}.
[2024-12-31 16:48:08,488][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: It takes 2/2=<<2/2=1>>1 bolt of white fiber
So the total amount of fabric is 2+1=<<2+1=3>>3 bolts of fabric
#### 3
[2024-12-31 16:48:08,488][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: If it takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber, then it takes 2\*0.5 = 1 bolt of white fiber. In total, it takes 2 bolts of blue fiber + 1 bolt of white fiber = <<2+1=3>>3 bolts.
[2024-12-31 16:48:10,868][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: The cost of the house and repairs came out to 80,000+50,000=$<<80000+50000=130000>>130,000
He increased the value of the house by 80,000*1.5=<<80000*1.5=120000>>120,000
So the new value of the house is 120,000+80,000=$<<120000+80000=200000>>200,000
So he made a profit of 200,000-130,000=$<<200000-130000=70000>>70,000
#### 70000
[2024-12-31 16:48:10,868][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: The increased value of the house is $80,000 + $50,000 = $<<80000+50000=130000>>1,300,000.
Josh's profit is the increased value of the house divided by the cost of the house, which is $1,300,000 / $80,000 = $<<130000/80000=16.25>>16.25.
[2024-12-31 16:48:11,807][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: He sprints 3*3=<<3*3=9>>9 times
So he runs 9*60=<<9*60=540>>540 meters
#### 540
[2024-12-31 16:48:11,807][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: James runs a total of 180 meters per sprint.  So he runs a total of 180 meters \* 3 sprints = <<180*3=540>>540 meters.
[2024-12-31 16:48:15,789][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: If each chicken eats 3 cups of feed per day, then for 20 chickens they would need 3*20=<<3*20=60>>60 cups of feed per day.
If she feeds the flock 15 cups of feed in the morning, and 25 cups in the afternoon, then the final meal would require 60-15-25=<<60-15-25=20>>20 cups of chicken feed.
#### 20
[2024-12-31 16:48:15,789][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: Wendi's flock has a total of 20 chickens. In the morning, she gives her flock 15 cups of feed, and in the afternoon, she gives her flock another 25 cups of feed for a total of 15 + 25 = <<15+25=40>>40 cups of feed.
Since Wendi's flock has 20 chickens, and she gives each chicken 3 cups of feed, she will need to give her flock a total of 20 chickens \* 3 cups of feed/chicken = <<20*3=60>>60 cups of feed.
Since the morning and afternoon feedings are 40 cups and 20 cups of feed respectively, Wendi will need to give her flock another 60 cups of feed - 40 cups = <<60-40=20>>20 cups of feed. Answer: \boxed{20}.
[2024-12-31 16:48:18,499][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: The discount price of one glass is 60/100 * 5 = $<<60/100*5=3>>3.
If every second glass is cheaper, that means Kylar is going to buy 16 / 2 = <<16/2=8>>8 cheaper glasses.
So for the cheaper glasses, Kylar is going to pay 8 * 3 = $<<8*3=24>>24.
And for the regular-priced glasses, Kylar will pay 8 * 5 = $<<8*5=40>>40.
So in total Kylar needs to pay 24 + 40 = $<<24+40=64>>64 for the glasses he wants to buy.
#### 64
[2024-12-31 16:48:18,499][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: To find out how much Kylar needs to pay for the glasses, you need to first find out how much one glass costs. To do this, you can divide the price of one glass by the number of seconds it takes to buy one glass:

$5 / glass \* 1 glass / 60% = $5 / glass \* 16 seconds / glass = $5 \* 16 / 60 = $10 / glass

So one glass costs $10. To buy 16 glasses, Kylar needs to pay:

$10 / glass \* 16 glasses = $160
[2024-12-31 16:48:20,602][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: If Seattle has 20 sheep, Charleston has 4 * 20 sheep = <<20*4=80>>80 sheep
Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, which is 2 * 80 sheep = <<2*80=160>>160 sheep
Together, the three has 20 sheep + 160 sheep + 80 sheep = <<20+160+80=260>>260 sheep
#### 260
[2024-12-31 16:48:20,603][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: If Seattle has 20 sheep, then Charleston has 4 \* 20 = <<4*20=80>>80 sheep.
Toulouse has 2 \* 80 = <<2*80=160>>160 sheep.
Thus, Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have a total of 160 + 80 + 20 = <<160+80+20=260>>260 sheep.
[2024-12-31 16:48:23,576][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: First find how many gigabytes are in 40% of the file: 200 GB * 40% = <<200*40*.01=80>>80 GB
Then divide that number by the download rate to find the time until Windows restarts: 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = <<80/2=40>>40 minutes
Then find the time to download the whole file after the restart: 200 GB / 2 GB/minute = <<200/2=100>>100 minutes
Then add the time to download 40% of the file, to download the whole file, and to wait for Windows to update: 40 minutes + 100 minutes + 20 minutes = <<40+100+20=160>>160 minutes
#### 160
[2024-12-31 16:48:23,577][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: If Carla is normally able to download 2 GB/minute, then it would take her 200GB/2GB/minute = 100 minutes to download the file fully.

However, the 40% of the way through the download is already at the point where Windows forces a restart to install updates. This means that Carla has to restart the download twice, which takes 20 minutes per restart.

Therefore, the actual time it takes Carla to download the file fully is 100 minutes + 20 minutes + 20 minutes = 140 minutes.

So it takes Carla 140 minutes to download the 200GB file.
[2024-12-31 16:48:29,300][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: When he turned around he was 3*60=<<3*60=180>>180 miles from home
He was only able to drive 4-2=<<4-2=2>>2 hours in the first four hours
In half an hour he goes 30*.5=<<30*.5=15>>15 miles
He then drives another 2-.5=<<2-.5=1.5>>1.5 hours
In that time he goes 80*1.5=<<80*1.5=120>>120 miles
So he drove 120+15=<<120+15=135>>135 miles
So he is 180-135=<<180-135=45>>45 miles away from home
#### 45
[2024-12-31 16:48:29,300][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: Let's start by calculating the distance John drives during the first 3 hours. He drives at a speed of 60 mph for 3 hours, so he drives a distance of 60 \* 3 = 180 miles.

After he turns around, he spends the next 2 hours driving at a standstill, so he drives a distance of 0 miles.

The next half-hour, he is driving at a speed of 30 mph. Let's use the formula: distance = speed x time. He is driving for 0.5 hours, so the distance he drives this way is 30 \* 0.5 = 15 miles.

After that, he gets to drive the remaining time of the 4 hours, which is 4 - 2 - 0.5 = 1.5 hours. He drives at a speed of 80 mph during this time, so the distance he drives is 80 \* 1.5 = 120 miles.

In total, John drives 180 + 0 + 15 + 120 = 315 miles. Since he is driving in a standstill during the second 2 hours, he is not going any further. Therefore, the distance he is from home at the end of those 4 hours is 315 miles.
[2024-12-31 16:48:33,209][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: Eliza is entitled to 45 -40 = <<45-40=5>>5 hours overtime pay.
Her hourly rate for the overtime pay is $10 x 1.2 = $<<10*1.2=12>>12.
So, Eliza will receive $12 x 5 =$<<12*5=60>>60 for overtime pay.
Her regular weekly earning is $10 x 40 = $<<10*40=400>>400.
Thus, Eliza will receive a total of $400 + $60 = $<<400+60=460>>460 for this week's work.
#### 460
[2024-12-31 16:48:33,209][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: If Eliza's rate per hour is $10 and she worked for 40 hours each week, then her total earnings for the week are $10 \* 40 = $<<10\*40=400>>400.
If Eliza received an overtime pay of 1.2 times her regular hourly rate, then her overtime pay is $10 \* 1.2 = $<<10\*1.2=12>>12.
If Eliza worked for 45 hours this week, then her overtime pay is $12 \* (45 - 40) = $<<12\*5=60>>60.
The total amount of Eliza's earnings for this week is $400 + $60 = $<<400+60=460>>460. Answer: \boxed{460}.

In the first two months, the total number of downloads of the program was 180+60 = <<180+60=240>>240
In the third month, the number of downloads of the program reduced by 30/100*180 = <<30/100*180=54>>54
There were 180-54 = <<180-54=126>>126 downloads in the third month.
In the three months, the total number of downloads of the program was 126+240 = <<126+240=366>>366
#### 366
[2024-12-31 16:48:36,944][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: The program had 60 downloads in the first month. The number of downloads in the second month was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, so 60 \* 3 = <<60*3=180>>180 downloads.
The number of downloads in the third month was 70% of the number of downloads in the second month, so 70% of 180 = <<70*.18=126>>126 downloads.
Over the three months, the program had 60 + 180 + 126 = <<60+180+126=366>>366 downloads. Answer: \boxed{366}.
[2024-12-31 16:48:39,772][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: The total charge for the doughnuts was 3 x $68 = $<<3*68=204>>204.
The total charge for the mini cupcakes was 2 x $80 = $<<2*80=160>>160.
The total charge for the mini cheesecakes was 6 x $55 = $<<6*55=330>>330.
Therefore the total amount Toula paid for the pastries was $204 + $160 + $330 = $<<204+160+330=694>>694.
#### 694
[2024-12-31 16:48:39,772][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: Toula spent $68 x 3 = $<<68*3=204>>204 on donuts.
Toula spent $80 x 2 = $<<80*2=160>>160 on mini cupcakes.
Toula spent $55 x 6 = $<<55\*6=330>>330 on mini cheesecakes.
The total cost of the pastries was $204 + $160 + $330 = $<<204+160+330=794>>794. Answer: \boxed{794}.
[2024-12-31 16:48:46,350][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: He makes $10.5 selling lemons each year because 7 x 1.5 = <<7*1.5=10.5>>10.5
He earns $7.5 each year from the lemon tree because 10.5 - 3 = <<10.5-3=7.5>>7.5
It will take 12 years to earn enough to pay off the tree because 90 / 7.5 = <<90/7.5=12>>12
He will make money in year 13 because 12 + 1 = <<12+1=13>>13
#### 13
[2024-12-31 16:48:46,350][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: To find out how many years it will take before Carlos starts earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the total revenue he will receive from selling the lemons and the cost of water and feed.

First, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling the lemons. Each year, the tree will grow 7 lemons, and each lemon sells for $1.5. Therefore, the total revenue from selling the lemons in one year is 7 \* $1.5 = $105.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of water and feed. The tree needs 3 cups of water and 1 cup of food every day, and each cup costs $3. Therefore, the cost of water and food in one year is $3 \* 3 = $9.

Then, we need to add the cost of water and food to the total revenue from selling the lemons to find the total income. The total income is $105 + $9 = $114.

Finally, we can divide the total income by the cost of planting the tree to find the number of years it will take for Carlos to start earning money. The cost of planting the tree is $90, and the total income is $114. Therefore, it will take $90 / $114 = 7.83 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.

Since we can only plant and harvest the lemon tree one year at a time, we will round this number down to 7 years. Therefore, it will take 7 years for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree.
[2024-12-31 16:48:49,761][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: First multiply the five remaining vacuum cleaners by two to find out how many Melanie had before she visited the orange house: 5 * 2 = <<5*2=10>>10
Then add two to figure out how many vacuum cleaners she had before visiting the red house: 10 + 2 = <<10+2=12>>12
Now we know that 2/3 * x = 12, where x is the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with. We can find x by dividing each side of the equation by 2/3, which produces x = 18
#### 18
[2024-12-31 16:48:49,761][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: Melanie started with 5 \* 3 = <<5*3=15>>15 vacuum cleaners.
Melanie sold 15 \* \* 2 = <<15*2=30>>30 vacuum cleaners from the red house.
Melanie sold 15 \* \* \* \* \* \* \* 2 = <<15*2*2=60>>60 vacuum cleaners from the orange house.
Melanie sold a total of 15 + 30 + 60 = <<15+30+60=105>>105 vacuum cleaners.
Melanie started with 105 \* \* 3 = <<105*3=315>>315 vacuum cleaners.
[2024-12-31 16:48:52,767][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: There are 20 x 20/100 = <<20*20/100=4>>4 students who enrolled in contemporary dance.
So, 20 - 4 = <<20-4=16>>16 students are enrolled in either jazz or hip-hop dance.
There are 16 x 25/100 = <<16*25/100=4>>4 students who enrolled in jazz dance.
Hence, 16 - 4 = <<16-4=12>>12 students enrolled in hip-hop dance.
This is 12/20 x 100% = 60% of the entire students.
#### 60
[2024-12-31 16:48:52,767][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: To find the percentage of the students enrolled in hip-hop dance, you need to first find the total number of students enrolled in jazz dance. Since 25% of the students enrolled in contemporary dance, there are 20 students \* 25% = <<20*25\*.01=5>>5 students enrolled in jazz dance.

The total number of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance is 5 students + 20 students = <<5+20=25>>25 students.

Since the entire class has 20 students, the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance is 25 students / 20 students = <<25/20=1.25>>125%.
[2024-12-31 16:48:54,360][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: If he purchases jewelry, he will make a profit of 2.5% which is $5000*(2.5/100) = $<<5000*(2.5/100)=125>>125
If he purchases electronic gadgets, he will make a profit of 1.2% which is $8000*(1.2/100) = $<<8000*(1.2/100)=96>>96
If he wants to maximize profit, since $125 > $96, he will choose to purchase jewelry, thereby making a profit of $<<125=125>>125
#### 125
[2024-12-31 16:48:54,360][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: To maximize the profit, the merchant should choose the purchase plan with the highest potential for appreciation. Since the jewelry market is expected to increase by 2.5% and the electronic gadgets market is expected to increase by 1.2%, the jewelry purchase plan is likely to provide a higher potential for appreciation. Therefore, the merchant should choose the jewelry purchase plan and purchase the jewelry for $5,000.

Then find the total amount Jill makes per week coaching: $30/hour * 15 hours/week = $<<30*15=450>>450/week
Then add those two amounts to find the total amount Jill makes per week: $700/week + $450/week = $<<700+450=1150>>1150/week
Then multiply that number by the number of weeks Jill works in a year to find her annual salary: $1150/week * 50 weeks/year = $<<1150*50=57500>>57,500
#### 57500
[2024-12-31 16:48:58,231][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: To calculate Jill's annual salary, you need to multiply her hourly rates by the number of hours she works in each position.

First, we need to calculate Jill's total weekly hours. She works 35 hours as a teacher and 15 hours as a coach, so she works a total of 35 + 15 = <<35+15=50>>50 hours.

Next, we need to calculate Jill's annual salary in美元。根据题目，Jill每小时得到20美元的薪水，作为教练她每周得到30美元的薪水。因此，她一年的总收入为20*50+30*50=<<20*50+30*50=1000>>1000美元。

[2024-12-31 16:49:01,142][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: She eats 3 eggs every day and there are 7 days in a week so she eats 3*7 = <<3*7=21>>21 eggs a week
After 4 weeks she will have eaten 4*21 = <<4*21=84>>84 eggs
There are 12 eggs in 1 dozen and she'll eat 84 eggs so that's 84/12 = <<84/12=7>>7 dozen eggs
#### 7
[2024-12-31 16:49:01,142][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: In 4 weeks, Claire will make 3 egg omelets every morning for a total of 4 \* 7 = <<4\*7=28>>28 egg omelets.
Each omelet requires 3 eggs to make and she is making 28 omelets so she will use 3 \* 28 = <<3\*28=84>>84 eggs in 4 weeks.
Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen and she will use 84 eggs in 4 weeks so she will eat 84 / 12 = <<84/12=7>>7 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks. Answer: \boxed{7}.
[2024-12-31 16:49:05,705][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: First figure out how many hours it takes to hike a 12-mile trail at 4 mph by dividing the distance by the speed: 12 miles / 4 mph = <<12/4=3>>3 hours
Next subtract the time Marissa already spent walking to find out how much time she has left: 3 hours - 1 hour - 1 hour = <<3-1-1=1>>1 hour
Now figure out how much distance she has left by subtracting the distance she already traveled from the total distance: 12 miles - 4 miles - 2 miles = <<12-4-2=6>>6 miles
Now divide the remaining distance by the remaining time to find out how fast in miles per hour Marissa has to travel: 6 miles / 1 hour = <<6/1=6>>6 mph
#### 6
[2024-12-31 16:49:05,705][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: First, we need to determine the total time it took Marissa to complete the 12-mile trail. We know that she took 1 hour to walk the first 4 miles and another 1 hour to walk the next two miles, so the total time is 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours.

Next, we need to determine the total distance Marissa walked. We know that the first 4 miles took her 1 hour to complete, so the distance she walked was 4 miles. The next two miles took her another 1 hour to complete, so the distance she walked was 2 miles. Therefore, the total distance she walked was 4 miles + 2 miles = 6 miles.

Finally, we can calculate Marissa's average speed. We know that she walked a total distance of 6 miles and took 2 hours to complete the hike, so her average speed is 6 miles / 2 hours = 3 miles per hour.

So, Marissa needs to walk at a speed of 3 miles per hour to average 4 miles per hour while hiking the remaining 8 miles of the trail.
[2024-12-31 16:49:10,960][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: There are 15 x 3/5 = <<15*3/5=9>>9 liters of water from the 15 liters pineapple drink.
After 1 liter of orange drink was spilled, there were 10 - 1 = <<10-1=9>>9 liters of orange drink left.
Out of the 9 liters, 9 x 2/3 = <<9*2/3=6>>6 liters are water.
Thus, there are a total of 9 + 6 = <<9+6=15>>15 liters of water out of the 24 liters.
#### 15
[2024-12-31 16:49:10,960][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: To find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of pineapple drink, we need to first find the total volume of the orange drink that was added to the pineapple drink. This can be done by dividing the volume of the orange drink by the proportion of water in the orange drink.

The proportion of water in the orange drink is 2/3, so the volume of the orange drink is 2/3 \* 10 liters = 6.67 liters.

The volume of the pineapple drink is 3/5 \* 15 liters = 9 liters.

When the orange drink is added to the pineapple drink, the total volume is 6.67 liters + 9 liters = 15.67 liters.

However, since you spill 1 liter of the orange drink as you pour it, the remaining volume of the orange drink is 6.67 liters - 1 liter = 5.67 liters.

The amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of pineapple drink is the same as the total volume of the pineapple drink, which is 9 liters. So there is 9 liters of water in the remaining 24 liters of pineapple drink.

[2024-12-31 16:49:12,340][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: Billy sold 1 DVD to his first customer, and 2 DVDs to his second customers. So in total, he sold 1 + 2 = <<1+2=3>>3 DVDs on Tuesday.
[2024-12-31 16:49:12,956][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: The candle burns for 5 - 1 = <<5-1=4>>4 hours.
Thus, the candle will be 2 * 4 = <<2*4=8>>8 centimeters shorter.
#### 8
[2024-12-31 16:49:12,957][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: If the candle burns for 4 hours, it will have melted by 2 centimeters per hour x 4 hours = 8 centimeters.
[2024-12-31 16:49:14,975][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: Let X be the original price of the book. The discounted price is X - X*25% = $19.50.
Combining like terms, we get .75X = $19.50
Dividing both sides by .75, we get X = $26.
#### 26
[2024-12-31 16:49:14,975][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: The original price of the book can be found using the formula:

Original price = Current price / (1 - Discount percentage)

Substituting the given values, we get:

Original price = $19.50 / (1 - 0.25)

Original price = $19.50 / 0.75

Original price = $130

Therefore, the original price of the book was $130.
[2024-12-31 16:49:20,548][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: Five packs of milk cost $3 x 5 = $<<3*5=15>>15.
Four apples cost $1.50 x 4 = $<<1.5*4=6>>6.
The total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples is $12 + $15 + $6 = $<<12+15+6=33>>33.
Thus, the boxes of pizza cost $50 - $33 = $<<50-33=17>>17.
Therefore, Marie ordered $17/$8.50 = <<17/8.5=2>>2 boxes of pizza.
#### 2
[2024-12-31 16:49:20,548][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: Marie spent a total of $50 on one chicken meal, 5 packs of milk, and 4 apples. The cost of one chicken meal is $12, so the cost of 5 packs of milk is 5 * $12 = $<<5*12=60>>60. The cost of 4 apples is 4 * $1.50 = $<<4\*1.5=6>>6. The total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples is $60 + $6 + $12 = $<<60+6+12=78>>78.

Since Marie paid a total of $50, the cost of the boxes of pizza must have been $50 - $78 = $<<50-78=-28>>-28. However, it is not possible for the cost of the boxes of pizza to be negative, so there must be an error in the problem statement.

If each box of pizza costs $8.50, Marie ordered 28 / $8.50 = <<28/8.5=3.22>>3.22 boxes of pizza. Since boxes of pizza must be whole numbers, it is not possible to order a fraction of a box, so the answer must be round up to the nearest whole number, which is 4 boxes of pizza.

She spent 3 \* $22.50 = $<<3*22.5=67.50>>67.50 on pants.
She spent 3 \* $42 = $<<3*42=126>>126 on shoes.
In total, Mishka spent $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $<<49.5+67.5+126=233.50>>233.50 on all the clothing items. Answer: \boxed{233.5}.
[2024-12-31 16:49:29,844][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: Each container of ice cream has 15 servings and she eats 1 serving a night so after 60 days she will need 60/15 = 4 containers of ice cream
If each carton costs $4.00 and she needs 4 containers then it will cost her 4*4 = $<<4*4=16.00>>16.00
#### 16
[2024-12-31 16:49:29,844][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: If Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, and the cartons have 15 servings per carton, then she purchases 15 / 1 = <<15/1=15>>15 cartons of ice cream.
At a cost of $4.00 per carton, the total cost of the ice creams she purchases is $4 / carton \* 15 cartons = $60.00.
After 60 days, Cynthia will have purchased and consumed 60 days \* 7 nights \* 1 servings of ice cream = <<60*7*1=420>>420 servings of ice cream.
Since each carton has 15 servings, the number of cartons she needs to purchase to have enough servings for 420 servings is 420 servings / 15 servings / carton = <<420/15=28>>28 cartons.
Since each carton costs $4.00, the total cost of the cartons she needs to purchase is $4 / carton \* 28 cartons = $<<4\*28=112>>112.00.
Therefore, Cynthia will have spent a total of $60.00 + $112.00 = $<<60+112=172>>172 on ice cream.
[2024-12-31 16:49:30,684][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: He traveled 20 miles + 15 miles = <<20+15=35>>35 miles not counting the distance between stops.
Henry traveled 60 miles - 35 miles = <<60-35=25>>25 miles between his first and second stop.
#### 25
[2024-12-31 16:49:30,684][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: It is not possible to accurately answer this question without additional information.

[2024-12-31 16:49:33,062][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: The second pair of heels costs 33 * 2 = $<<33*2=66>>66.
The heels together cost 66 + 33 = $<<66+33=99>>99.
The boots cost $5 more than both pairs of heels together, so the boots cost 99 + 5 = $104.
#### 104
[2024-12-31 16:49:33,062][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: If one pair of heels costs $33 and the other costs twice as much, then the second pair of heels costs 2 \* $33 = $<<2*33=66>>66.
In total, the two pairs of heels costs $33 + $66 = $<<33+66=99>>99.
Since the boots cost $5 less than the two pairs of heels, the boots cost $99 - $5 = $<<99-5=94>>94.
Therefore, the boots cost $94.
[2024-12-31 16:49:39,610][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: The total ratio representing their ages is 7+11= <<7+11=18>>18
Since the fraction of the ratio that represents Allen's age is 11/18, Allen's current age is 11/18*162 = <<11/18*162=99>>99
If Allen is currently 99 years old, in 10 years he will be 99+10 = <<99+10=109>>109 years old
#### 109
[2024-12-31 16:49:39,610][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: The total ratio of Darrell and Allen's ages is 7 + 11 = 18. From the total ratio of their ages, we can calculate the fraction of Darrell's age that represents the age they have now.

Darrell's age / (Darrell's age + Allen's age) = 7 / 18

We know that Darrell and Allen's total age is 162, so we can substitute that into the above equation to find Darrell's age:

Darrell's age = (7 / 18) \* 162
Darrell's age = 56

Allen's age can be calculated using the total age and Darrell's age:

Allen's age = 162 - Darrell's age
Allen's age = 162 - 56
Allen's age = 106

Since we want to find Allen's age 10 years from now, we can simply add 10 to his current age:

Allen's age 10 years from now = Allen's age + 10
Allen's age 10 years from now = 106 + 10
Allen's age 10 years from now = 116

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is 116.
[2024-12-31 16:49:42,928][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: The second person guessed 60 because 20 + (80/2)= <<20+(80/2)=60>>60
The second guessed 100 because 80 x 1.25 = <<80*1.25=100>>100
The total amount guessed is 240 because 80 + 60 + 100 = <<80+60+100=240>>240
The average amount guessed is 80 because 240 / 3 = <<240/3=80>>80
#### 80
[2024-12-31 16:49:42,928][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: To find the average guess, we need to first determine what the sum of the guesses is. If one friend guessed 80 jelly beans, and the other friend guessed 20 more than half the first one, then the sum would be 80 + (20/2) = 80 + 10 = 90 jelly beans.

The third friend guessed 25% more than the first one, meaning they guessed 25% of the first one plus the first one, which would be (25/100) \* 80 = 20 jelly beans.

The total guesses are 90 + 20 = 110 jelly beans. Therefore, the average guess is 110 / 3 = 36.67 jelly beans.

x=<<40=40>>40
Gretchen has 40+30=<<40+30=70>>70 gold coins
#### 70
[2024-12-31 16:49:46,823][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: Gretchen has 110 coins and there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, so there are 110 + 30 = <<110+30=140>>140 silver coins.
So, Gretchen has 110 - 140 = <<110-140=-30>>-30 gold coins.
This is a negative number, which means that there are not enough gold coins for Gretchen. In order to have a positive number, you would need to add more gold coins to Gretchen's collection.
[2024-12-31 16:49:48,311][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: Half of Raymond's jewels is 40/2 = <<40/2=20>>20
Since Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels, he has 20+5 = <<5+20=25>>25 jewels.
If Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron, he has 25-2 = 23 jewels.

[2024-12-31 16:49:52,991][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: He scored 4*.25=<<4*.25=1>>1 point more in the second 20 minutes
So he scored 4+1=<<4+1=5>>5 points in the second 20 minutes
So in total, he scored 4+5=<<4+5=9>>9 points in the 40 minutes
#### 9
[2024-12-31 16:49:52,991][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: To find the total number of points that Mike scored in the second 20 minutes, we need to know how many points he scored in that time. Let's say he scored x points in the second 20 minutes.

We know that the total number of points that Mike scored in the second 20 minutes is equal to the number of points he scored in the first 20 minutes plus the number of points he scored in the second 20 minutes. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x = 4 + (4 \* 0.25)

To solve for x, we first need to calculate the value of the fraction within the parentheses. 4 \* 0.25 is equal to 1, because 4 divided by 4 is 1. Then we can simplify the equation by combining the like terms:

x = 4 + 1

This gives us the total number of points that Mike scored:

x = 5

So, Mike scored a total of 40 minutes \* 5 points = <<40*5=200>>200 points.

He spent a total of $295 in total because $200 + $195 = $<<200+195=495>>495.
He still has $5 left, so he spent a total of $495 + $5 = $<<495+5=500>>500.
He spent $500 on video games because $495 + $5 = $<<495+5=500>>500.
He spent a total of $135 on legos because $500 - $295 = $<<500-295=205>>205.

[2024-12-31 16:50:12,021][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: If Dana can skip at half the speed she can run, then she can run at 3*2=<<3*2=6>>6 miles per hour.
And since she can run at a speed that is 4 times faster than she can walk, this means she can walk at 6/4=1.5 miles per hour.
If two-thirds of the time is spent walking, then she walks for 6*(2/3)=<<6*(2/3)=4>>4 hours.
If one-third of the time is spent running, then she runs for 6-4=<<6-4=2>>2 hours.
Thus, she runs for 2 hours at 6 miles per hour, or 2*6=<<2*6=12>>12 miles.
She walks for 4 hours at 1.5 miles per hour, or 4*1.5=<<4*1.5=6>>6 miles.
Thus, altogether, she travels 12+6=<<12+6=18>>18 miles.
#### 18
[2024-12-31 16:50:12,021][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: If Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk, and she can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run, then the following information is known:

* The rate at which Dana can run is 3 miles per hour (from the statement that she can skip at 3 miles per hour).
* The rate at which Dana can walk is 3/2 times the rate at which she can run, or 2 miles per hour (from the statement that she can skip at 3 miles per hour).

If Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking, then the following is known:

* 2/3 of the time Dana is walking, and 1/3 of the time she is running.
* During the time she is walking, Dana is traveling at a rate of 2 miles per hour.
* During the time she is running, Dana is traveling at a rate of 3 miles per hour.

To find out how many miles Dana can travel in six hours, you need to calculate the total distance she travels during each of the three-fourths of the time. During the one-fourth of the time (6 hours / 4), Dana spends running and during the three-fourths of the time (6 hours / 4) she spends walking.

During the one-fourth of the time, Dana spends running and during the three-fourths of the time, she spends walking. Therefore, during this time, Dana spends a total of 2 / 3 \* 6 hours = 4 hours walking. During this time, Dana spends 1 / 4 \* 6 hours = 3 / 4 hours running.

The total distance Dana travels during this time is 4 hours \* 2 miles/hour = 8 miles.

During the other two-thirds of the time, Dana spends walking and running. During this time, Dana spends a total of 2 / 3 \* 6 hours = 4 hours walking. During this time, Dana spends 2 / 3 \* 6 hours = 4 / 3 hours running.

The total distance Dana travels during this time is 4 hours \* 3 miles/hour = 12 miles.

In six hours, Dana can travel a total of 8 miles + 12 miles = 20 miles.

1200 feet is beyond the 1000-foot reach of the dragon's flames by a distance of 1200-1000=<<1200-1000=200>>200 feet.
#### 200
[2024-12-31 16:50:15,949][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: With the gemstone in hand, Polly could throw the javelin out 400 feet + the distance she could throw it without the gemstone, which is 400 feet, for a total distance of 400 feet + 400 feet = 800 feet.
Since the dragon is 1000 feet high, this means that the dragon's flames would still reach a distance of 1000 feet - 800 feet = 200 feet from where the javelin landed.
Therefore, Polly would still be outside the reach of the dragon's flames by a distance of 200 feet.

[2024-12-31 16:50:23,561][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: If the total calorie target is 2000 and I have consumed 1800 calories then I have 2000-1800 = <<2000-1800=200>>200 calories left to eat
If each serving of chips has 250 calories and I only have 200 calories left to eat, then I can only eat 200/250 of a serving = 4/5 of a serving
We also know that a 300g bag of chips has 5 servings, hence each serving has 300g/5 = <<300/5=60>>60 grams
If I can only eat 4/5 of a serving, then I can eat only 60g * 4/5 = 240g/5 = 48 grams
#### 48
[2024-12-31 16:50:23,561][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: If a bag of chips has 250 calories per serving and there are 5 servings in a bag, then the total amount of calories in the bag is 250 \* 5 = 1250 calories.

If your daily calorie target is 2000 and you have already consumed 1800 calories, then you have consumed 1800 / 2000 = 0.9 or 90% of your daily calorie target.

To find out how many grams of chips you can eat to meet your daily calorie target while also consuming the entire bag, you will need to divide the total amount of calories in the bag by the number of calories in a serving.

So, to find the number of grams of chips you can eat, you will need to divide the total amount of calories in the bag (1250) by the number of calories in a serving (250). This will give you 1250 / 250 = 5 grams of chips.

However, since each bag has 250 calories, you will need to consume 250 / 2000 = 0.125 servings of chips to meet your daily calorie target.

Therefore, you can eat 5 grams of chips (assuming you divide the bag into 5 equal servings) or 0.125 servings of chips (assuming you consume the entire bag).

1 pound of beeswax costs $10.00 and he needs 2 pounds so his supplies will cost 10*2 = $<<10*2=20.00>>20.00
He wants to sell each candle for $2.00 each and he's selling 20 candles so that's 2*20 = $<<2*20=40.00>>40.00
If he makes $40.00 selling candles and his supplies cost $20.00 then his net profit is 40-20 = $<<40-20=20.00>>20.00
#### 20
[2024-12-31 16:50:33,237][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: To determine Charlie's net profit, you need to calculate his total income and total expenses.

First, we need to calculate the total cost of the beeswax and wicks. We know that for every pound of beeswax, Charlie can make 10 tapered candles, so for 20 candles, he will use 20 \* 10 = <<20*10=200>>200 pounds of beeswax.

The cost of 200 pounds of beeswax is $10.00 per pound, so the total cost of beeswax is $10 \* 200 = $<<10\*200=2000>>2000.

Next, we need to calculate the total cost of the wicks. We know that for every pound of beeswax, Charlie can make 10 tapered candles, so for 20 candles, he will use 20 \* 10 = <<20*10=200>>200 wicks.

The cost of 200 wicks is $10.00 per pound, so the total cost of wicks is $10 \* 200 = $<<10\*200=2000>>2000.

Now we can calculate Charlie's total expenses. His total expenses are the cost of the beeswax and wicks, which is $2000 + $2000 = $<<2000+2000=4000>>4000.

Next, we can calculate Charlie's total income. He sells each candle for $2.00, so for 20 candles, his total income is $20 \* $2 = $<<20\*2=40>>40.

Finally, we can calculate Charlie's net profit. His total income is $40, and his total expenses are $4000. Therefore, his net profit is $40 - $4000 = $<<40-4000=-3960>>-3960.

Since Charlie's net profit is negative, it means that he made a loss of $3960.
[2024-12-31 16:50:38,028][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: If she wrote five articles on Monday, then on Tuesday she wrote 2/5* 5 = 2 more articles.
The total number of articles she wrote on Tuesday is 5+2 = <<5+2=7>>7
On Wednesday, the number of articles was twice the number she wrote on Tuesday, so it was 2*7 = <<2*7=14>>14 articles.
Over the three days, she wrote 5+7 +14 = <<5+7+14=26>>26 articles.
If each article takes her 4 hours to research and write about, she spent 4*26 = <<4*26=104>>104 hours on all the articles.
#### 104
[2024-12-31 16:50:38,028][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles, which took an average of 4 hours each to research and write, so she spent 20 hours on Monday writing.

On Tuesday, Meredith wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday, which is 2/5 \* 5 = 2 more articles. The total number of articles she wrote on Tuesday is 5 + 2 = 7. If each article took an average of 4 hours to write, the total number of hours she spent writing on Tuesday is 7 \* 4 = 28 hours.

On Wednesday, Meredith wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 2 \* 7 = 14 articles. The total number of articles she wrote on Wednesday is 7 + 14 = 21. If each article took an average of 4 hours to write, the total number of hours she spent writing on Wednesday is 21 \* 4 = 84 hours.

In the three days, Meredith spent a total of 20 + 28 + 84 = 142 hours writing articles.
[2024-12-31 16:50:43,000][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: Let's let x be the number of post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased.
Then, the total number of post-it notes she had when she left the store was 80+x.
And if she used 220 Post-it notes at work and had 23 left, then 80+x=220+23
Subtracting 80 from each side of the equation, we see that x=220+23-80=<<220+23-80=163>>163 Post-it notes.
#### 163
[2024-12-31 16:50:43,000][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: Let's say the package of Post-it notes contained x post-it notes.
Candice placed 80 post-it notes in her purse before heading out to work, so she had 80 + x post-it notes in the package that she purchased.
When she stopped off at the store and purchased the package, she had x + 80 post-it notes in the package.
After placing the single Post-it note on each of the 220 cups of coffee, she had 220 + 1 = 221 post-it notes in total.
Since she had 23 post-it notes remaining overall, the total number of post-it notes that she had in the package before purchasing the additional 80 post-it notes must have been x + 80 - 23 = x + 57.
Thus, we can write the equation:
x + 57 = 221
Subtracting 57 from both sides, we get:
x = 221 - 57 = 164
Therefore, the package of Post-it notes that Candice purchased contained 164 post-it notes.
[2024-12-31 16:50:45,882][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: He bought 200 / 40 = <<200/40=5>>5 blue ties
So he bought 5 * 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 red ties
Each red tie cost $40 * .5 = $<<40*.5=20>>20 more than blue ties
So they each cost $40 + $20 = $<<40+20=60>>60
So he spent $60 * 10 = $<<60*10=600>>600 on red ties
So he spent $200 + $600 = $<<200+600=800>>800 on ties
#### 800
[2024-12-31 16:50:45,882][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties, which means they cost 50% + 100% = 150% of the blue ties.

The total cost of the blue ties is $40 \* 2 = $<<40*2=80>>80.

The total cost of the red ties is $80 \* 1.5 = $<<80*1.5=120>>120.

The total cost of the ties is $120 + $80 = $<<120+80=200>>200. Answer: \boxed{200}.
[2024-12-31 16:50:47,972][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: If Tracy used a piece of wire 4 feet long, since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the total length of the wire in inches was 12*4=<<12*4=48>>48 inches.
Since the wire was cut into pieces 6 inches long, Tracy obtained 48/6=<<48/6=8>>8 pieces
#### 8
[2024-12-31 16:50:47,973][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: If 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, then 4 feet is equal to 4 \* 12 = <<4*12=48>>48 inches.
Since 1 inch is equal to 2 feet, then 48 inches is equal to 48 / 2 = <<48/2=24>>24 feet.
Since each piece is 6 inches long, Tracy obtained 24 / 6 = <<24/6=4>>4 pieces.

He needs to remove 7.5 more pounds because 15 - 7.5 = <<15-7.5=7.5>>7.5
He needs to remove 15 toys because 7.5 / .5 = <<15=15>>15
#### 15
[2024-12-31 16:50:56,777][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: To find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove, we need to know how many pounds his book bag weighs after he removes the comic books. Since the comic books weigh 1/4 pound each, the 30 comic books he removes will weigh 30 \* 1/4 = 7.5 pounds.

Since the toy weighs 1/2 pound each, Uriah needs to remove 7.5 - 15 = <<7.5-15=0>>0 pounds of toys.

Since Uriah needs to remove 0 pounds of toys, he doesn't need to remove any toys.
[2024-12-31 16:51:00,839][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: On Thursday the mechanic charged a total of 6*60 + 4*40 = $<<6*60+4*40=520>>520.
On Friday the mechanic charged a total of 12*40 = $<<12*40=480>>480.
Thus, on Thursday, the day with higher revenue, the mechanic had 520-480 = $<<520-480=40>>40 more revenue than on Friday.
#### 40
[2024-12-31 16:51:00,839][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: The mechanic earned $60 per tire for the truck tires and $40 per tire for the car tires.

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires, so earned $60 \* 6 = $<<60*6=360>>360.

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires, so earned $40 \* 12 = $<<40*12=480>>480.

The mechanic earned a total of $360 + $480 = $<<360+480=840>>840 on the day.

To find the difference in revenue, we need to subtract the amount earned on Thursday from the amount earned on Friday:

$840 - $360 = $<<840-360=480>>480.

The mechanic earned $480 more on Friday than on Thursday.
[2024-12-31 16:51:01,582][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: Patchy has just had 3 * 7 = <<3*7=21>>21 kittens
Since Trixie's kittens are 12, both cats have 21 +12 = <<21+12=33>>33 kittens.
Combining the adopted kittens with those from the two cats, the Doubtfire family now has 7 + 33 = <<7+33=40>>40 kittens.
#### 40

Jean can fill up 28 / 2 = <<28/2=14>>14 bags with lollipops
#### 14
[2024-12-31 16:51:04,486][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: Jean has 30 lollipops and eats 2, so he has 30 - 2 = <<30-2=28>>28 lollipops left.
He wants to package 2 lollipops in one bag, so he needs to divide the remaining lollipops by the number of lollipops in each bag. This means he needs to divide the number of remaining lollipops by 2 to determine how many bags he can fill.
28 lollipops / 2 lollipops per bag = <<28/2=14>>14 bags.
So, Jean can fill 14 bags with the remaining lollipops.

[2024-12-31 16:51:09,002][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: The boxes can weigh up to 5000 pounds - 3755 pounds = <<5000-3755=1245>>1245 pounds in total.
There can be 1245 / 15 = <<1245/15=83>>83 boxes loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit.
#### 83
[2024-12-31 16:51:09,002][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: Let's call the number of boxes "x". The weight of the truck and the boxes is 3755 pounds, so the weight of the boxes is 15x pounds. The weight of the truck is 3755 - 15x pounds.

We know that the total weight of the truck and the boxes cannot exceed the weight limit of the bridge, which is 5000 pounds. Therefore:

15x + 3755 - 15x <= 5000

Simplifying this inequality, we get:

3755 <= 5000

This is a false inequality, so there is a maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck. Since the weight of each box is 15 pounds, the maximum number of boxes is 3755 / 15 = 250.

Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck is 250.

The total number of bad, unripe and sour oranges is therefore 1+5+2 = <<1+5+2=8>>8 oranges
The rest which is 25-8 = <<25-8=17>>17 oranges are good
#### 17
[2024-12-31 16:51:14,154][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: There are 25 - 1 = <<25-1=24>>24 oranges that are good.
There are 20 / 100 \* 25 = <<20/100*25=5>>5 oranges that are not good.
There are 2 / 100 \* 25 = <<2/100*25=0.05>>0.05 oranges that are sour.
The total number of oranges in the basket is 25 - (5 + 0.05) = <<25-(5+0.05)=20.95>>20.95 oranges. Since it is not possible to have a fraction of an orange, the answer is 20 oranges.
[2024-12-31 16:51:17,714][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: The total cost of the broch was 500+800=$<<500+800=1300>>1300
The insurance was 1300*.1=$<<1300*.1=130>>130
So she pays 1300+130=$<<1300+130=1430>>1430
#### 1430
[2024-12-31 16:51:17,714][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: First, we need to add the cost of the material and the jeweler's fee to find the total cost of the brooch. $500 + $800 = $<<500+800=1300>>1300.

Then, we need to multiply the total cost by the percentage to find the amount of the insurance premium. 10% of $1300 is $<<1300\*10\%=130>>130.

Finally, we add the cost of the insurance premium to the total cost to find the total amount Janet paid. $1300 + $130 = $<<1300+130=1430>>1430.

Therefore, Janet paid $1430 for the brooch.
[2024-12-31 16:51:24,228][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: First find how many years Marcy works after 20 years: 30 years - 20 years = <<30-20=10>>10 years
Then multiply that number by the amount of her pension she gets per year: 10 years * 5% = 50%
Then multiply that percentage by the total amount of the full pension to find how much she gets: $50,000 * 50% = $<<50000*50*.01=25000>>25,000
#### 25000
[2024-12-31 16:51:24,229][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: If Marcy works for the same company for 40 years and gets an annual pension of $50,000/year, the total cost of her pension is $50,000 \* 40 = $<<50000\*40=200000>>200,000.

Starting after 20 years, Marcy becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year. If the value of the pension is $200,000, her starting pension would be $200,000 \* 5% = $<<200000\*5\%=10000>>10,000.

If Marcy quits after 30 years, she will have earned a total of 30 years of service, which is equivalent to a pension value of $200,000 \* (10 years \* 5%) = $<<200000\*(10\*5)\%=100000>>100,000.

Her monthly pension will be calculated as follows:

$100,000 / (30 years \* 12 months/year) = $<<100000\/(30\*12)=2500>>2500.

Therefore, if Marcy quits after 30 years, her annual pension will be $2500.

For the first six months, the streaming service charged her a total of 6*140 = $<<6*140=840>>840
For the next half of the year, the streaming service company charged her 10/100*140 = $<<10/100*140=14>>14 less
She paid $140-$14 = $<<140-14=126>>126 each month for the remaining half of the year,
In total, she paid 126*6 = $<<126*6=756>>756 for the other half of the year for the streaming service.
The total amount of money she paid at the end of the year is $840+$756 = $<<840+756=1596>>1596
#### 1596
[2024-12-31 16:51:31,799][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to know the total amount charged for the first half of the year and the total amount charged for the second half of the year.

Let's assume that the total amount charged for the first half of the year is x, and the total amount charged for the second half of the year is x - 10%x or 0.9x.

We know that the total amount charged for the entire year is $140 per month, which is equal to $140 x 12 = $1,680 per year.

So we can write the equation:

x + 0.9x = 1680

This equation represents the total amount charged for the entire year.

Simplifying the equation, we get:

1.9x = 1680

Dividing both sides by 1.9, we get:

x = 900

This means the total amount charged for the first half of the year is $900.

Now we can calculate the total amount charged for the second half of the year:

Total amount charged for the second half of the year = Total amount charged for the entire year - Total amount charged for the first half of the year
Total amount charged for the second half of the year = $1,680 - $900 = $780

So Aleena paid $900 for the first half of the year and $780 for the second half of the year, for a total of:

$900 + $780 = $1,680

Therefore, Aleena paid $1,680 for the streaming service by the end of the year.

#### 300
[2024-12-31 16:51:35,502][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: Sophia can drive 12 gallons of gas in her car. If she needs 4 gallons to fill it up again, then the tank has 12 - 4 = 8 gallons of gas left in it.

Since Sophia has already traveled 100 miles, she has 8 gallons of gas left in the tank. To know how far she can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to divide the remaining gas by the amount of gas in the tank.

8 gallons of gas / 12 gallons of gas in the tank = 0.6667 gallons of gas left in the tank.

Sophia can drive 0.6667 gallons of gas / 100 miles = 66.67 miles on a single tank of gas.

Therefore, Sophia can drive 66.67 miles on a single tank of gas.

So, the total number of gems in the treasure chest is 175 + 140 + 280 = <<175+140+280=595>>595.
#### 595
[2024-12-31 16:51:41,371][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: The number of rubies in the chest was 175 - 35 = <<175-35=140>>140.
The number of emeralds in the chest was 140 \* 2 = <<140*2=280>>280.
The number of gems in the chest was 175 + 140 + 280 = <<175+140+280=525>>525. Answer: \boxed{525}.
[2024-12-31 16:51:43,421][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: There are twice as many boys as girls, so if there are 60 girls, there are 2*60 = <<2*60=120>>120 boys
There are 120 + 60 = <<120+60=180>>180 students in total
If there are 5 students to each teacher, then 180 students would need 180/5 = <<180/5=36>>36 teachers
#### 36
[2024-12-31 16:51:43,422][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: There are 60 girls, which means there are 60/2 = <<60/2=30>>30 boys.
The total number of students is 30 boys + 60 girls = <<30+60=90>>90 students.
Since there are 5 students for every teacher, there are 90 students / 5 students/teacher = <<90/5=18>>18 teachers. Answer: \boxed{18}.
[2024-12-31 16:51:50,721][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: In 8 weeks, Bailey receives $5 * 8 = $<<5*8=40>>40 in allowance
Bailey started with $100 - $40 = $<<100-40=60>>60
#### 60
[2024-12-31 16:51:50,721][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: Let's say Bailey started with $x.

In the first week, she has $x - $5.
In the second week, she has $x - $5 + $5 = $x - $0 = $x.
In the third week, she has $x - $5 + $5 + $5 = $x - $0 = $x.
In the fourth week, she has $x - $5 + $5 + $5 + $5 = $x - $0 = $x.
In the fifth week, she has $x - $5 + $5 + $5 + $5 + $5 = $x - $0 = $x.
In the sixth week, she has $x - $5 + $5 + $5 + $5 + $5 + $5 = $x - $0 = $x.
In the seventh week, she has $x - $5 + $5 + $5 + $5 + $5 + $5 + $5 = $x - $0 = $x.
In the eighth week, she has $x - $5 + $5 + $5 + $5 + $5 + $5 + $5 + $5 = $x - $0 = $x.

Since the total amount of money at the end of the 8 weeks is $100, and the amount of money in each week is $x, we can set up the equation:

$x \times 8 = $100

Solving for $x, we find that:

$x = \frac{100}{8} = $12.50

Since we asked for the starting amount of money, we must round up to the nearest whole dollar, which is $13.
[2024-12-31 16:51:52,188][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: She teaches 5 dance classes 5 days a week so that's 5*5 = <<5*5=25>>25 classes
She teaches 25 classes during the week and 8 classes on Saturday for a total of 25+8 = <<25+8=33>>33 classes
There are 15 students in each of the 33 classes so there are 15*33 = <<15*33=495>>495 students
Each student pays $15.00 per class and there are 495 students so Judy makes 15*495 = $<<15*495=7425>>7,425
#### 7425
[2024-12-31 16:51:52,188][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: Judy makes 5 classes x 15 students = $75.00 per day.
Judy makes 5 classes x $75.00 = $375.00 per day.
Judy makes $375.00 x 5 days = $1,875.00 in 1 week.

[2024-12-31 16:51:55,895][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: Tommy raised 43 brownies x $3/brownie = $<<43*3=129>>129 by selling brownies.
Tommy raised 23 slices x $4 = $<<23*4=92>>92 by selling cheesecakes.
In total Tommy has raised $129 + $92 = $<<129+92=221>>221
#### 221
[2024-12-31 16:51:55,895][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: Tommy raises $3 per slice of brownies \* 43 slices = $<<3*43=134>>134 from selling brownies.
Tommy also raises $4 per slice of cheesecakes \* 23 slices = $<<4\*23=92>>92 from selling cheesecakes.
Tommy raises a total of $134 + $92 = $<<134+92=226>>226.
[2024-12-31 16:52:00,146][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: A $150 x 2/100 = $<<150*2/100=3>>3 interest will be charged for each unit.
So, each cell phone costs $150 + $3 = $<<150+3=153>>153.
The total amount to be paid for 5 cell phones is $153 x 5 = $<<153*5=765>>765.
Thus, Shiela will pay $765/3 = $<<765/3=255>>255 each month.
#### 255
[2024-12-31 16:52:00,147][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: To calculate the amount that Shiela will pay each month for 3 months, we need to first calculate the total amount of the loan. The total amount of the loan can be calculated as follows:

5 cell phones at $150 each for a 3-month installment = $150 \* 5 \* 3 = $2250

The total amount of the loan is $2250.

The interest that will be charged on the loan can be calculated as follows:

2% of $2250 = $2250 \* 0.02 = $45

The interest that will be charged is $45.

So, the total amount that Shiela will pay for 3 months is the loan amount of $2250 plus the interest charge of $45, which is $2250 + $45 = $2305.

Therefore, Shiela will pay $2305 for 3 months.
[2024-12-31 16:52:04,146][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: Artie will round his marigolds up from $2.74 to $3, since the number following the 2 is 5 or higher.
Artie will round his petunias up from $1.87 to $2, since the number following the 1 is 5 or higher.
Artie will round his begonias down from $2.12 to $2, since the number following the 2 is less than 5.
Artie sells 12 marigolds x $3 = $<<12*3=36>>36
Artie sells 9 petunias x $2 = $<<9*2=18>>18
Artie sells 17 begonias x $2 = $<<17*2=34>>34
Altogether, Artie will make $36 + $18 + $34 = $<<36+18+34=88>>88
#### 88
[2024-12-31 16:52:04,147][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: First, we need to find the rounded price of each flower. We start by taking the $2.74 price of the marigolds and rounding it down to $3.00. We then take the $1.87 price of the petunias and round it down to $2.00. Finally, we take the $2.12 price of the begonias and round it down to $2.00.

So, the rounded price of each flower is:

* Marigolds: $3.00
* Petunias: $2.00
* Begonias: $2.00

Next, we add up the rounded price of all the flowers to find the total amount Artie will make. We add $3.00 + $2.00 + $2.00 for a total of $7.00.

Therefore, Artie will make $7.00 in total.
[2024-12-31 16:52:07,395][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: Level 3 is 32 square feet because 16 x 2 = <<16*2=32>>32
Level 2 is 64 square feet because 32 x 2 = <<32*2=64>>64
Level 1 is 128 square feet because 64 x 2 = <<64*2=128>>128
The four levels total to 240 square feet because 128 + 64 + 32 + 16 = <<128+64+32+16=240>>240
The average square footage of a level is 60 because 240 / 4 = <<240/4=60>>60
#### 60
[2024-12-31 16:52:07,395][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: If the top level has a square footage of 16, and each level has half the square footage of the level below it, then the second level has a square footage of 16/2 = 8 square feet. The third level has a square footage of 8/2 = 4 square feet. The fourth level has a square footage of 4/2 = 2 square feet.

The total square footage of the sandcastle is 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30 square feet.

To find the average square footage of a level, you can divide the total square footage by the number of levels. In this case, there are 4 levels, so the average square footage of a level is 30 / 4 = 7.5 square feet.
[2024-12-31 16:52:16,533][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: The number of cups of dog food given for the first 180 days is 180 * 1 = <<180*1=180>>180 cups
The number of days left in the year is 365 - 180 = <<365-180=185>>185
The number of cups of dog food given for the rest of the first year is 185 * 2 = <<185*2=370>>370 cups
The total number of cups given in the first year is 180 + 370 = <<180+370=550>>550 cups
The number of bags of dog food used in the first year is 550 / 110 = <<550/110=5>>5 bags
#### 5
[2024-12-31 16:52:16,533][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: First, we need to determine how many cups of dog food Cecilia will need in the first year. She has to feed the puppy 1 cup of dog food every day for the first 180 days, so she will need 180 cups of food. Then, she has to feed the puppy 2 cups of dog food every day for the rest of its life, but we don't know how long that is. Let's assume that the puppy lives for 5 years, or 360 days.

To find out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will need in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food she will need in those 5 years. She needs 180 cups of food in the first year, and then 360 cups of food in the second year, and so on. Let's call this total amount of cups of food "Dog Food Total".

We know that one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, so we can divide the total amount of cups of food by the number of cups in a bag to find out how many bags Cecilia will need.

Dog Food Total (in cups) = 180 + 360 + \*360

Dog Food Total (in bags) = (180 + 360 + \*360) / 110

To find out how many bags Cecilia will need, we need to solve for the variable "*". Using the distributive property, we can simplify the expression as follows:

Dog Food Total (in bags) = (180 + 360 + \*360) / 110
Dog Food Total (in bags) = (180 + 360 + 3960) / 110
Dog Food Total (in bags) = 4140 / 110
Dog Food Total (in bags) = 37.63

Since we can't use a fraction of a bag, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Cecilia will need 38 bags of dog food in the first year.
[2024-12-31 16:52:18,867][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: If Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, and Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, Raymond does 1/2*400 = 200 pounds of laundry.
Sara also does 4 times as much laundry as David, meaning David does 400/4 = <<400/4=100>>100 pounds of laundry.
The difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is 200-100 = <<200-100=100>>100 pounds
#### 100
[2024-12-31 16:52:18,867][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: If Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, and Raymond does half as much as Sarah, then Raymond does 1 / 2 \* 4 = 2 times as much laundry as Sarah.
The amount of laundry that Raymond does is 2 \* 400 = 800 pounds.
The amount of laundry that David does is 4 \* 400 = 1600 pounds.
The difference in the amount of laundry that Raymond and David do is 1600 - 800 = 800 pounds.

The cost of using packages of 3 is 6 × $2.50 = $<<6*2.5=15>>15.
Find how many packages of 2 would be needed which is 18 ÷ 2 = <<18/2=9>>9.
The cost of using packages of 2 is 9 × $1 = $<<9*1=9>>9.
Vincent would save $15 - $9 = $<<15-9=6>>6.
#### 6
[2024-12-31 16:52:21,581][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: The cost of each flower is $2.50 divided by 3 packages, which is $2.50 / 3 = $0.8333 per package.
The cost of each flower is $1.00 divided by 2 packages, which is $1.00 / 2 = $0.50 per package.
Vincent will save $0.8333 - $0.50 = $0.3333 per package.
Since there are 18 flowers in total, Vincent will save a total of $0.3333 \* 18 = $6.4494.

#### 70
[2024-12-31 16:52:22,294][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: The groomer offers a $100 discount for being a new customer, so the cost of the grooming is $100 - $100 = $0.
[2024-12-31 16:52:24,020][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: Each of the girls got 24 x 1/6 = <<24*1/6=4>>4 liters of water.
So the two girls got a total of 4 x 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 liters.
Thus, a total of 8 + 6 = <<8+6=14>>14 liters of water were gotten by the two girls and the boy.
Therefore, 24 - 14 = <<24-14=10>>10 liters of water were left.
#### 10
[2024-12-31 16:52:24,020][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: Two girls each got 1/6 of the 24 liters of water, so they each got 24\*1/6=4 liters of water.
Then a boy got 6 liters of water, so in total, the 3 of them have 4+6=10 liters of water.
Therefore, 24-10=14 liters of water were left.

[2024-12-31 16:52:32,782][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: Alex weighs 125*4-2 = <<125*4-2=498>>498.
Their combined weights are 125+498 = <<125+498=623>>623 pounds.
#### 623
[2024-12-31 16:52:32,782][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: To find out what Grace's weight is, we'll call it "x".
To find out what Alex's weight is, we can set up the equation:
x = 4(125) - 2
We can simplify this equation by first multiplying both sides by 4:
4x = 500 - 2
Then we can subtract 2 from both sides to get:
4x = 498
Finally, we can divide both sides by 4 to find Grace's weight:
x = 124.5 pounds
Grace weighs 124.5 pounds.
To find out what Alex's weight is, we can substitute Grace's weight into the equation:
x = 4(125) - 2
We can simplify this equation by first multiplying both sides by 4:
4x = 500 - 2
Then we can subtract 2 from both sides to get:
4x = 498
Finally, we can divide both sides by 4 to find Alex's weight:
x = 124.5 pounds
Alex weighs 124.5 pounds.
Grace weighs 124.5 pounds and Alex weighs 124.5 pounds. Their combined weight is 249 pounds.

[2024-12-31 16:52:35,278][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: Let L be the number of losses.
The number of wins is L + <<+8=8>>8.
The team played (L+8) + L = 2L + 8 = 22 games.
So, 2L = 22 - 8 = 14
So L = 14/2 = <<14/2=7>>7 losses.
Therefore, the team won 22 – 7 = <<22-7=15>>15 games.
#### 15
[2024-12-31 16:52:35,279][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: The team won 8 games more than they lost, so they won a total of 22 games + 8 games = <<22+8=30>>30 games.

He goes on 4 vacations a year, so he has been on 4 * 11 = <<4*11=44>>44 vacations.
Gene has 1 shirt from each vacation, so he has 44 * 1 = <<44*1=44>>44 quilt blocks in all.
#### 44
[2024-12-31 16:52:38,184][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: Gene has been on a total of 4 vacations and has been vacationing since he was 23 years old, so he has been going on vacations for a total of 4+23=27 years.
In 27 years, Gene has had 27 years \* 4 vacations = 108 vacations.
Gene has 27 years \* 27 different shirts = <<27\*27=729>>729 different shirts.
So he has a total of 729 shirts - 1 shirt (since he is currently wearing the same shirt) = <<729-1=728>>728 quilt blocks.
[2024-12-31 16:52:39,958][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: The second time Greg’s alarm went off, it rang three times as long as the first, so it rang 3 * 4 = <<3*4=12>>12 times the second time.
The third time it went off, it rang half as long as the second, so it rang 12 / 2 = <<12/2=6>>6 times the third time.
In all, Greg’s alarm rang 4 + 12 + 6 = <<4+12+6=22>>22 times.
#### 22
[2024-12-31 16:52:39,958][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: The alarm rang for 4 \* 4 = <<4*4=16>>16 times when it first went off.
It then rang for 3 \* 16 = <<3*16=48>>48 hours before it was turned off.

[2024-12-31 16:52:44,254][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: In a month, Sylvie earns $600. which totals $600/month * 12 months/year = $7200 in a year.
Sylvie earnings will increase by 10/100 * $7200/year = $<<10/100*7200=720>>720/year after 5 years.
In three years, the total increase in her salary will be 3 years * $720/year = $<<3*720=2160>>2160
After three years, Sylvie will be paid $7200 + $2160 = $<<7200+2160=9360>>9360
#### 9360
[2024-12-31 16:52:44,254][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: If Sylvie has been in the company for 5 years and is currently paid $600 per month, her annual salary is $600 \* 12 = $<<600\*12=7200>>7200.

As per the company's policy, Sylvie is eligible for a salary increase of 10% of her initial salary. Since she has been in the company for 5 years, she is eligible for a salary increase of 5 years \* 10% = 50%.

The new salary that Sylvie will be paid is $600 \* (1 + 50%) = $<<600*(1+50)=900>>900.

Therefore, if Sylvie stays in the company for 8 more years (5 years + 3 years), her annual salary will be $900 \* 12 = $<<900\*12=10800>>10800.
[2024-12-31 16:52:47,357][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: Let m be the number of copies Marilyn sold and h be the number Harald sold. We know that m + h = 80,000 and m = 10h.
Substituting the second equation into the first, we get 10h + h = 88,000
Combining like terms, we get 11h = 88,000
Dividing both sides by 11, we get h = 8,000
#### 8000
[2024-12-31 16:52:47,357][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: Let's say Harald sold x copies of his record.

According to the problem, "Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's." So, "Marilyn sold 10x copies of her record."

We also know that "Together, they sold 88,000 copies." So, "x + 10x = 88,000."

Simplifying the equation, we get "11x = 88,000."

Dividing both sides by 11, we find that "x = 8,000."

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies of his record.

To feed 20 dinosaur adults, he will need 20*10=<<20*10=200>>200 pounds of potato salad.
To feed 5 dinosaur children, he will need 5*5=<<5*5=25>>25 pounds of potato salad.
In total, he will need to bring 200+25=<<200+25=225>>225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic.
#### 225
[2024-12-31 16:52:53,505][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: If there will be 20 adults and 5 children at the picnic, then there will be a total of 20 + 5 = <<20+5=25>>25 people at the picnic.
Since an adult will eat 10 lbs of potato salad, Ted will need to bring 25 \* 10 = <<25*10=250>>250 lbs of potato salad to the picnic.
Since a child will eat half as much as an adult, a child will eat 10 lbs / 2 = <<10/2=5>>5 lbs of potato salad.
Since there will be 5 children at the picnic, Ted will also need to bring 5 \ * 5 = <<5*5=25>>25 lbs of potato salad to the picnic.
In total, Ted will need to bring 250 lbs + 25 lbs = <<250+25=275>>275 lbs of potato salad to the picnic.
[2024-12-31 16:52:55,403][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: Marcia has 4 + 2 = <<4+2=6>>6 pets.
Jan has 3 * 6 = <<3*6=18>>18 pets
In total, the three have 4 + 6 + 18 = <<4+6+18=28>>28 pets.
#### 28
[2024-12-31 16:52:55,403][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: If Cindy has four pets, then Marcia has 4 + 2 = <<4+2=6>>6 pets.
If Marcia has six pets, then Jan has 6 \* 3 = <<6*3=18>>18 pets.
Thus, the three have a total of 4 + 6 + 18 = <<4+6+18=28>>28 pets. Answer: \boxed{28}.
[2024-12-31 16:52:55,743][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: James is 10 and 1 year younger than Corey, so Corey is 10 + 1 = <<10+1=11>>11 years old
Amy is 2 years younger than Corey so is 11 - 2 = 9 years old
Amy is also 5 years older than Jackson, so Jackson is 9 - 5 = <<9-5=4>>4 years old
#### 4
[2024-12-31 16:52:55,743][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: The age of Jackson is 10 - 1 = 9 years old.
[2024-12-31 16:52:57,309][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: If Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, which was two seconds faster than Gerald used to run the 400-meter hurdles, then Gerald initially would run the 400-meter hurdles in 38+2=<<38+2=40>>40 seconds.
10% of 40 seconds is 40*0.1=<<40*0.1=4>>4 seconds.
The improved diet reduced Gerald's race time to 40-4=<<40-4=36>>36 seconds.
#### 36
[2024-12-31 16:52:57,310][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: It is not possible to determine how fast Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles based on the information provided. The improvement in Gerald's speed from his diet change to Lee's previous time. Additionally, the time that Lee spent training to run the 400-meter hurdles (38 seconds) is not relevant to the time it took Gerald to improve his speed.
[2024-12-31 16:53:00,432][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: If there are two cats for every dog, and the number of dogs is 60, the number of cats is 2*60 = <<2*60=120>>120
The combined number of cats and dogs is 120+60 = <<120+60=180>>180
The number of rabbits pets is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats, a total of 180-12 = 168
The total number of pets in the compound is 168+180 = <<168+180=348>>348
#### 348
[2024-12-31 16:53:00,432][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: If there are two cats for every dog, and the number of dogs is 60, then there are 60 / 2 = <<60/2=30>>30 cats.
Thus, the combined number of cats and dogs is 30 + 60 = <<30+60=90>>90.
Since the number of rabbits pets is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats, then there are 90 - 12 = <<90-12=78>>78 rabbits.
In total, there are 78 + 30 = <<78+30=108>>108 pets in the neighborhood. Answer: \boxed{108}.
[2024-12-31 16:53:02,777][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: There are 200 x 2/5 = <<200*2/5=80>>80 boys in Grade 5.
So, 200 - 80 = <<200-80=120>>120 are girls.
Out of the 120 girls, 120 x 2/3 = <<120*2/3=80>>80 are in the girl scout.
Therefore, 120 - 80 = <<120-80=40>>40 girls are not in the girl scout.
#### 40
[2024-12-31 16:53:02,777][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: There are 200 students in Grades 5.

The number of boys in Grade 5 is 200 \* 2 / 5 = 80 students.

The number of girls in Grade 5 is 200 \* 3 / 5 = 120 students.

The number of girls in the Girl Scout is 120 \* 2 / 3 = 80 students.

The number of girls not in the Girl Scout is 120 - 80 = 40 students.
[2024-12-31 16:53:06,447][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: James slept 9 hours * 2/3 = <<9*2/3=6>>6 hours.
So, Harry slept 9 - 6 = <<9-6=3>>3 hours more than James.
#### 3
[2024-12-31 16:53:06,447][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: Let's say that Harry slept for x hours and James slept for y hours. We know that y is equal to (3/2)x, because James slept only 2/3 of what Harry slept. We also know that x + y = 9, because Harry slept for 9 hours and James slept for (3/2)x hours.

Now we can set up the equation:

x + (3/2)x = 9

We'll solve for x:

(1 + 3/2)x = 9

5/2 x = 9

x = 18/5

So Harry slept for 18/5 = 3.6 hours.

Now we can find the difference:

3.6 - 2.4 = 1.2

Harry slept 1.2 more hours than James.
[2024-12-31 16:53:08,535][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: Tomatoes lose half their volume when made into sauce, so Freda started with 32 * 2 = <<32*2=64>>64 ounces of tomatoes.
At 16 ounces per can, she used 64 / 16 = <<64/16=4>>4 cans of tomatoes.
At 3 tomatoes a can, Freda used 3 * 4 = <<3*4=12>>12 tomatoes.
#### 12
[2024-12-31 16:53:08,535][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we can set up an equation based on the information given. Let's call the number of tomatoes Freda used x. We know that each 16 ounce can of tomatoes contains three tomatoes, so Freda's last batch of sauce used 32 / 16 = 2 cups of tomatoes. Since each cup contains three tomatoes, Freda used 2 \* 3 = <<2*3=6>>6 tomatoes. Answer: \boxed{6}.
[2024-12-31 16:53:09,311][INFO] [Judge] [Ground Truth]: The cars that exited do not need to be included so there were 30 original cars – 5 cars that exited = <<30-5=25>>25 cars that drove through the traffic jam.
Most of the cars exited in the final 15 minutes so in the first 15 minutes, there must have been 25 total cars – 20 cars that drove through in the final 15 minutes = 5 cars that drove through the traffic jam.
#### 5
[2024-12-31 16:53:09,311][INFO] [Judge] [Answer]: In the first 15 minutes, 30 cars - 5 cars that took an exit - = <<30-5=25>>25 cars drove through the traffic jam.
